* **wave_length:**  Affects the amount of refraction (bending) of the light within the prism. Different wavelengths bend at slightly different angles (dispersion), but this is not visibly apparent in the provided images since we only see a single white beam. This effect isn't directly observable in the given video, so we will not be including it.
* **incident_position:** The point where the light beam hits the prism directly determines where it enters the prism.
* **incident_angle:** The angle at which the light beam strikes the prism's surface.  Along with the incident position, this determines the internal path of the beam and thus its exit point and angle.
* **reflected_position:** Where the light beam exits the prism after refraction. This is determined by the incident position, incident angle, and the prism's material properties (refractive index, which is subtly related to wavelength).

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (wave_length):** As mentioned before, the wavelengths effect is not obvious in the images, and we can therefore not conclude that the wavelength affects any other variables.  Hence, all zeros in the first row.
* **Row 2 (incident_position):**  Changing the incident position directly changes the reflected_position.  So, matrix[1][3] = 1.
* **Row 3 (incident_angle):**  Changing the incident angle also directly changes the reflected_position. So, matrix[2][3] = 1.
* **Row 4 (reflected_position):** The reflected position is an effect, not a cause of the other variables, therefore all zeros in the fourth row.


It's important to note that this analysis assumes the prism's material and geometry remain constant.  If those properties changed, they too would become causal factors. Also, in a more comprehensive simulation with visible dispersion (separation of colors), the wavelength would directly influence the reflected angle and thus the reflected position.

However, the wavelength of the light leaving the prism is the *same* as the wavelength entering.  This one is tricky, and depends on whether you are talking about the light *inside* the prism, or the light beam as a complete entity going in and coming out. This means the *angle* can alter how much each constituent wavelength separates within the prism, and therefore very slightly the exiting position of the original beam, but this effect is minor compared to the positional effects.

* **wave_length** impacts how the light interacts with the prism, influencing the angle of refraction and therefore the **reflected_position**. It's worth noting that while wavelength doesn't directly affect the *position* where the light *initially* hits the prism (incident_position), it *does* affect the position where it *exits* the prism, as different wavelengths refract at slightly different angles.

 [0, 0, 0, 1],  # incident_angle influences reflected_position
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # reflected_position is an effect, not a cause
```

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

1. **incident_position -> reflected_position:**  Changing where the ray hits the prism changes where it comes out.
2. **incident_position -> incident_angle:** The position the ray hits the prism relative to the incoming beam directly determines the angle of incidence.
3. **incident_angle -> reflected_position:**  The angle at which the light enters the prism dictates the angle it leaves after refraction.
4. **wave_length -> reflected_position:** Different wavelengths of light refract at different angles within the prism, leading to different exit positions.



It's important to understand that  `incident_position` and `incident_angle` are highly interrelated, as changing one directly impacts the other in this setup. However, they are distinct concepts and both contribute causally to the final `reflected_position`, along with the `wave_length` of the light.

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`wave_length` (Row 1):**
    * `wave_length` -> `incident_position`:  While the wavelength itself doesn't directly *cause* the position the light hits the prism, different wavelengths *can* affect the perception of the incident position due to slight variations in refraction at the entry point. However, this is a subtle effect and likely not the primary driver in the presented scenario.  It is assumed that if the wavelength changes, the source of the light (and therefore the initial incident position) will stay the same, therefore we mark this as 0.
    * `wave_length` -> `incident_angle`: The wavelength doesn't determine the incident angle. The angle is determined by the direction of the incoming light source, which is independent of wavelength.
    * `wave_length` -> `reflected_position`:  Wavelength *does* influence the reflected position. Different wavelengths refract (bend) at slightly different angles within the prism. This difference in refraction leads to different exit points and therefore different reflected positions. Therefore this entry is 1.

* **`incident_position` (Row 2):**
    * `incident_position` -> `reflected_position`: Where the light beam hits the prism directly affects where it exits. Changing the incident position changes the internal path of the light and thus the reflected position. Therefore, this entry is 1.

* **`incident_angle` (Row 3):**
    * `incident_angle` -> `reflected_position`: The angle at which the light hits the prism is crucial in determining the angle at which it refracts and thus its final reflected position.  Therefore this is a 1.


* **`reflected_position` (Row 4):**
    * `reflected_position` -> (other variables): The reflected position is the *effect* of the other variables, not a cause. It doesn't influence the wavelength, incident position, or incident angle.


In summary, the wavelength, incident position, and incident angle all contribute to determining the final reflected position of the light beam after passing through the prism. The animation shows the angle of the prism being changed by moving the incident position, further demonstrating that incident position is a key factor in how the light refracts.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`wave_length` -> `incident_position`**: While wavelength doesn't directly *cause* the incident position in a strictly physical sense, in the context of these visualizations, the animation engine may adjust the incident position to showcase the light's behavior given its wavelength.  Imagine that different wavelengths of light are slightly offset when entering the prism to demonstrate how different wavelengths refract differently. This doesn't reflect a true causal link in reality, but rather a presentation choice in the simulation.

* **`incident_position` -> `incident_angle`**: The position where the light ray strikes the prism directly determines the angle of incidence.  If the ray hits the prism higher up, the incident angle is shallower; lower down, the angle is steeper.

* **`incident_angle` -> `reflected_position`**: The angle at which the light ray enters the prism dictates how it refracts and reflects, ultimately determining where the light leaves the prism (the reflected position).  Different incident angles cause the light to exit at different positions.


**Why other relationships are 0 (no direct causality):**

* **`wave_length` -> `incident_angle`**:  There's no *direct* causal link. Although wavelength affects how much the light refracts *within* the prism, it doesn't directly set the initial incident angle.  The incident angle is determined solely by the position where the light ray strikes the prism face.

* **`wave_length` -> `reflected_position`**: Wavelength influences the *path* of the ray inside the prism (due to refraction), and thus indirectly affects the reflected position. However, the incident angle *mediates* this effect. The wavelength doesn't directly cause the reflected position; its influence is channeled through its effect on refraction and thus the angle inside the prism.

*  No other relationships exist because the reflected position is the final effect in the chain, and wavelength only directly affects the initial incident position.  The rest of the relationships are sequential steps in the light's interaction with the prism.

* **wave_length:** Affects how much the light bends (refracts) within the prism. Different wavelengths refract at slightly different angles, leading to the separation of colors (dispersion).  It also slightly affects the reflected_position due to different refractive index for different wavelengths.
* **incident_position:** Determines where the light enters the prism. This directly influences where the light refracts inside the prism and subsequently where it exits (reflected_position), and the internal incident_angle on the second surface of the prism..
* **incident_angle:** The angle at which the light strikes the surface of the prism. This directly influences the angle of refraction inside the prism and consequently the reflected_position.
* **reflected_position:**  Is the effect. It's determined by the wave_length, incident_position, and incident_angle.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`wave_length` -> `incident_position` (1):**  While wavelength doesn't directly *cause* the incident position in the physical setup shown, the experiment likely involves varying the wavelength of the incident light.  Different wavelengths will refract differently within the prism. This means that if you change the wavelength, you likely also need to adjust the incident position of the light source if you want to continue shining the beam on the prism. Thus, there is a causal relationship in the experimental design where changing the wavelength may require the experimenter to change the incident position.

* **`wave_length` -> `reflected_position` (1):**  Different wavelengths of light refract at different angles within the prism. This directly affects where the light exits the prism (the reflected position).

* **`incident_position` -> `reflected_position` (1):** Where the light beam initially strikes the prism (incident position) directly impacts where it will exit (reflected position).

* **`incident_angle` -> `reflected_position` (1):** The angle at which the light hits the prism (incident angle) directly influences the angle of refraction and therefore the exit point (reflected position).


**Why other relationships are 0:**

The reflected position is the effect, not the cause, of the other variables.  The wavelength, incident position, and incident angle are independent variables that can be manipulated. They don't directly influence each other in this simple setup.  Changing one won't intrinsically change the others.

 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # incident_position
 [1, 1, 0, 1],  # incident_angle
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # reflected_position
```

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`incident_angle` causes `incident_position` (matrix[2][1] = 1):**  Changing the angle at which the light hits the prism directly affects where on the prism's surface the light initially contacts. A steeper angle will lead to a higher incident position, and vice versa.

* **`incident_angle` causes `reflected_position` (matrix[2][3] = 1):** Snell's Law dictates how light refracts and reflects based on the incident angle.  Changing the incident angle directly influences the angle of reflection/refraction, thereby changing where the light exits or reflects off the prism.

* **`wave_length` causes `incident_position` (matrix[0][1] = 1):** This is a subtle effect, and  it's not apparent in the images or typical physics demonstrations with prisms using monochromatic light. Different wavelengths of light refract slightly differently (dispersion). This means if a beam containing multiple wavelengths is aimed at a fixed point on the prism, the different wavelength components will refract at slightly different angles which lead to slightly different incident positions.

**Why other entries are 0:**

* **`wave_length` doesn't directly cause `reflected_position`:** While wavelength affects how much light bends (dispersion), the *position* of the reflected/refracted ray is primarily determined by the incident angle and incident position.  Wavelength would affect the *angle* of the exit ray but not the position where the ray exits if incident angle and incident position are controlled.
* **`incident_position`,  `reflected_position`, and  `wave_length` don't cause `incident_angle`:** The angle of incidence is an independent variable determined by the setup of the experiment (i.e., the direction of the incoming light beam).
* Neither `incident_position` nor `reflected_position` cause any other variable. They are effects, not causes, in this system.


It's important to note that this analysis assumes a simplified model. In a more complex real-world scenario, there might be other indirect or second-order effects. For example, imperfections in the prism's surface could introduce scattering, which would have a minor influence on the reflected position. However, the matrix above represents the primary, direct causal relationships.

* **incident_position** influences **incident_angle**:  The position where the light ray strikes the prism determines the angle at which it enters relative to the prism's surface normal.  As the incident position moves up or down the prism face, the angle of incidence changes.

* **incident_angle** influences **reflected_position**:  The angle at which the light enters the prism dictates the angle at which it refracts both upon entry and exit.  This, in turn, determines the position where the refracted ray emerges from the prism.  

* **wave_length** influences **reflected_position**: although not displayed in the images, different wavelengths of light refract at slightly different angles (dispersion). This leads to a separation of colors (as seen in the classic Pink Floyd prism cover) where different wavelengths exit the prism at different positions.

* **incident_angle** further affects the **reflected_position**. A different incident angle inside the prism will change the angle of refraction and therefore where the light exits.
* **wave_length** is independent of the spatial variables but affects how much the light bends (refracts) at each interface. Different wavelengths bend at slightly different angles, causing the separation of light into its constituent colors (dispersion). This primarily affects the **reflected_position**. While a change in wavelength could potentially slightly shift the *perceived* incident angle *due to dispersion inside the prism*, the actual angle of the ray entering the prism remains unchanged.

* **incident_position** influences the point where the light ray interacts with the prism's surface. This directly affects where the refraction and reflection processes occur, thus impacting both the internal path of the light ray and its eventual exit point.

* **incident_angle** dictates how the light ray interacts with the prism's surface. It determines the angle of refraction as the ray enters the prism and the angle of reflection/refraction as it exits. This angle therefore influences both the internal path and the final outgoing direction of the ray.

* **wave_length** affects the refractive index within the prism.  Different wavelengths bend (refract) at slightly different angles. This influences the angle at which the ray exits the prism and, consequently, its final position.

* There is no demonstrated causal link between wavelength and incident position/angle. The position and angle are determined independently of the light's wavelength.

The reflected_position is a consequence of the other three variables.

* **`wave_length`**: While not directly shown in the changing visualizations, wavelength *would* influence the angle of refraction.  Different wavelengths refract at slightly different angles, leading to the dispersion of light into its spectrum (like a rainbow). This effect isn't explicitly depicted, as the refracted beam remains white. However, the concept is fundamentally linked to light behavior through a prism.

* **`incident_position`**:  The point where the light ray hits the prism directly affects the point where it exits and the angle it takes upon exiting.

* **`incident_angle`**:  Similar to the incident position, the angle at which the light ray enters the prism affects both the exit point and the refracted angle.

* **`reflected_position`**: This is the effect, not the cause. The reflected position is determined by the incident angle, incident position, and, implicitly, wavelength.

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`wave_length` -> `incident_position`:**  The wavelength of the incident light indirectly influences where it strikes the prism.  While the light source's position is the primary determinant, subtle refraction effects dependent on wavelength can slightly alter the exact point of incidence. This effect is likely minimal in the given images but theoretically exists.

* **`incident_position` -> `incident_angle`:** The position where the light strikes the prism directly determines the angle of incidence relative to the surface normal at that point. Moving the incident beam up or down the prism's face changes the angle it makes with the perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact.

* **`incident_angle` -> `reflected_position`:**  The angle of incidence is the primary factor determining the direction of the reflected ray, and thus, its position as it leaves the prism. Snell's law governs this relationship.

**Why other relationships are 0 (no direct causation):**

* **`wave_length` does not directly cause `incident_angle` or `reflected_position`:** While wavelength affects refraction *inside* the prism, which indirectly influences the final reflected angle, it's the *incident angle* itself that is the direct cause. The wavelength primarily determines how the light spreads out into its constituent colors (if it's not monochromatic), not the overall direction of reflection.

* **`incident_position` does not directly cause `reflected_position`:** The reflected position is determined by the *angle* at which the light strikes the surface, not directly by its up/down position. Two beams striking at the same angle but at different vertical positions will be reflected in the same direction (parallel).

* **`reflected_position` doesn't cause any other variable:** It's an effect, not a cause in this system.


It's important to note that the apparent simplicity of the scene might mask more complex interactions, especially if the light source emits a spectrum of wavelengths or the prism material has significant dispersion properties.  But based on a simple reflection scenario with a largely monochromatic light source, the matrix provided captures the dominant causal relationships.

* **incident_position** influences **reflected_position**:  Where the light hits the prism directly affects where the refracted light exits.  Changing the incident position shifts the exit point.
* **incident_angle** influences **reflected_position**: The angle at which the light strikes the prism impacts the angle of refraction and, consequently, the exit point. A steeper incident angle results in a different exit position.
* **wave_length** has no direct causal link to any other variables **in this specific setup**. While wavelength affects the *degree* of refraction (different wavelengths bend at slightly different angles—resulting in dispersion if the incident light is composed of multiple wavelengths), the animation shows a single white beam of light. This means dispersion isn't directly visually represented, and we can't infer a causal relationship from the animation alone. The output beam is always shown as a single beam in this case, and its position varies based on the incident position and angle. The animation does not show the wavelength dependence that would normally be present.
