**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant -> deformation (1):** The spring constant directly influences how much the spring deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight. This is a direct causal relationship.

* **weight -> deformation (1):**  The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform. A heavier weight causes more deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same.  This is a direct causal relationship.

* **deformation -> spring_constant (0) / weight(0):** The amount of deformation the spring experiences does *not* cause a change in either the spring constant (an inherent property of the spring) or the weight applied.  The deformation is the *result* of these two factors, not the *cause*.


The animation demonstrates these relationships: changing the mass (weight) or material properties of the block (effectively changing the spring constant needed to support it) leads to changes in how much the spring compresses (deformation). However, the","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant (row 1):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It doesn't get affected by the weight placed on it or the deformation of the spring.  Therefore, it causes neither weight nor deformation.

* **weight (row 2):**  The weight is an external factor. While it *influences* the deformation, it's not *caused* by it.  The spring constant also doesn't affect the weight itself. Thus, weight doesn't cause either of the other variables.

* **deformation (row 3):** The deformation of the spring is the *effect*.  It's *caused* by both the spring constant and the weight. A higher spring constant will resist deformation, leading to less deformation for a given weight. A higher weight, given the same spring constant, will cause more deformation. Therefore, both spring constant and weight have a causal effect on deformation.

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`spring_constant` → `deformation`:** The spring constant (stiffness) of the spring directly influences how much it deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same weight. This is a direct causal relationship.
* **`weight` → `deformation`:** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform.  A heavier weight causes more deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same. This is also a direct causal relationship.
* **`deformation` → `spring_constant` & `weight` :** Deformation is the *effect*, not the *cause*. The deformation of the spring does *not* change the inherent spring constant of the spring itself.  Nor does the amount of deformation change the weight placed upon it.


Therefore, `spring_constant` and `weight` are independent variables that cause `deformation`, the dependent variable.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant -> deformation:**  A higher spring constant (stiffer spring) results in less deformation for the same weight. Conversely, a lower spring constant (weaker spring) results in more deformation for the same weight.  This demonstrates a direct causal relationship where the spring constant influences the amount of deformation.

* **weight -> deformation:** A heavier weight causes greater deformation of the spring. A lighter weight causes less deformation. This shows a direct causal relationship where the weight influences the deformation.

* **deformation -> spring_constant/weight:** Deformation is the *effect* of the spring constant and the applied weight. It does *not* cause changes in either the inherent stiffness of the spring (spring constant) or the weight itself.

The animation helps visualize this by showing how different weights (represented by the change in color and implied material density) affect the compression of the spring (deformation). It doesn't directly show the spring constant changing, but that's implied – if you were to swap out the spring for","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant --> deformation:** A higher spring constant (stiffer spring) results in less deformation for the same weight. Conversely, a lower spring constant (looser spring) leads to greater deformation for the same weight.  Therefore, the spring constant influences the deformation.

* **weight --> deformation:**  A heavier weight causes a larger deformation in the spring. A lighter weight causes less deformation.  Thus, weight directly influences deformation.

* **deformation does not cause changes in spring constant or weight:**  The deformation of the spring is a *result* of the spring constant and the applied weight.  The act of the spring deforming doesn't inherently change the spring's inherent stiffness or the mass of the object placed upon it.


The animation demonstrates this by alternating between two blocks of different apparent weights (presumably represented by material differences like wood and stone). The heavier block deforms the spring more than the lighter block.  The spring constant is implicitly constant throughout the animation since the same spring is used.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant and weight do not directly cause each other.**  The material properties of the spring determine the spring constant, and the mass of the object determines the weight. These are independent variables in this system.

* **spring_constant causes deformation:** A higher spring constant means a stiffer spring, thus, for the same weight, less deformation.

* **weight causes deformation:**  A heavier weight (larger force) applied to the spring results in a larger deformation.

* **Deformation does not directly cause changes in the spring constant or the weight:** While deformation is the *effect* of both spring constant and weight, it doesn't feed back and *cause* changes in either of those properties.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant (0, 0, 0):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It doesn't change based on the weight or deformation.  Therefore, it doesn't cause any of the other variables.

* **weight (1, 0, 0):**  The weight placed on the spring *causes* deformation. A heavier weight will cause a larger deformation, all other things being equal.  Weight doesn't cause the spring constant to change.

* **deformation (1, 1, 0):** The deformation of the spring is *caused* by both the weight applied and the spring constant. A higher weight or a lower spring constant (a ""weaker"" spring) will both lead to greater deformation. Deformation itself doesn't directly cause changes in either the spring constant or the weight.

The animation demonstrates these relationships. When the material changes (implying a change in spring constant), the deformation changes. Similarly","[[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]]"

* **weight -> deformation:** The weight (force) applied to the spring directly causes it to deform.  A heavier weight will cause more deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same. This is also a direct causal relationship.

* **deformation -> spring_constant/weight:** Deformation is an *effect* of the spring constant and the applied weight.  The deformation itself doesn't cause a change in the spring constant or the weight.  Therefore, there's no causal relationship in this direction.

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`spring_constant -> deformation (1)`:**  The spring constant (stiffness) directly influences how much the spring deforms. A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight, and a lower spring constant results in more deformation.

* **`weight -> deformation (1)`:** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform. A heavier weight causes more deformation, while a lighter weight causes less deformation.

* **`deformation -> spring_constant (0) / weight(0)`:**  The deformation of the spring is a *result* of the spring constant and the weight applied.  Changing the deformation itself does not directly change the inherent stiffness of the spring or the weight applied. It's the other way around.

Therefore, the spring constant and weight are independent variables that cause a change in the dependent variable, deformation.  There's no reverse causal link.

**Explanation:**

* **weight (0, 0, 0):**  The weight is an external force applied to the spring.  It's not *caused* by the spring constant or the deformation. It *influences* the deformation given a certain spring constant.

* **deformation (1, 1, 0):** The deformation of the spring is the *effect*. It is directly caused by both the spring constant and the weight. A higher weight causes more deformation (for a given spring constant). A lower spring constant causes more deformation (for a given weight). The deformation doesn't cause changes in the weight or the spring constant.

* **`weight` (1, 0, 0):** The weight applied to the spring *causes* a deformation. A heavier weight will cause a larger deformation, all else being equal. The weight itself doesn't depend on the spring constant or the deformation.

* **`deformation` (1, 1, 0):**  The deformation of the spring is *caused* by both the `spring_constant` and the `weight`. A stiffer spring (higher `spring_constant`) will deform less for a given weight.  A heavier weight will cause more deformation for a given `spring_constant`. The deformation doesn't directly cause a change in either the weight or the spring constant.

In this simplified context, we can interpret these relationships as follows:

* **spring_constant:** An inherent property of the spring. It *influences* how much the spring deforms under a given weight, but isn't *caused* by weight or deformation.
* **weight:** The weight placed on the spring *causes* the spring to deform.  A greater weight leads to greater deformation (assuming the spring constant remains the same).
* **deformation:** The deformation of the spring is the *effect* caused by the weight and the spring constant.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],  # spring_constant doesn't directly cause anything else
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation is the effect, doesn't cause anything in this system

* **spring_constant and weight cause deformation:** The amount the spring deforms (compresses) depends on both the weight placed on it and the stiffness of the spring (spring constant). A heavier weight will cause more deformation, while a stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less for the same weight.

* **Deformation does *not* cause weight or spring_constant:** The deformation of the spring is a result of the weight and spring constant, not the other way around.  The properties of the spring and the object placed on it don't change because the spring compresses.
