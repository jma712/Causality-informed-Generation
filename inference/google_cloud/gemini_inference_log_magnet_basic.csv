Here's why:

* **Magnetic Bar Direction Causes Needle Direction:**  The needle is a compass.  Compasses align themselves with the magnetic field lines created by the bar magnet.  As the bar magnet rotates, the magnetic field lines shift, causing the needle to rotate accordingly.

* **Needle Position is Irrelevant:** The needle's starting position doesn't affect how it responds to the magnetic field.  Regardless of where the needle starts, it will always try to align itself with the magnetic field.  The needle's position changes *as a result* of aligning with the field, not the other way around.  There's no causal link from needle position to anything else.

**Explanation:**

* **needle_position** does not cause **magnetic_bar_direction**: Moving the needle around doesn't change which way the magnet is pointing.
* **needle_position** does not cause **needle_direction**: The needle's starting position doesn't determine which way it will point after being influenced by the magnet.
* **magnetic_bar_direction** causes **needle_direction**:  As seen in the animation, rotating the magnetic bar directly causes the needle to rotate to align itself with the magnetic field.
* **needle_direction** does not cause **magnetic_bar_direction**: The needle's orientation has no impact on the magnet's orientation.
* **needle_direction** does not cause **needle_position**: While the needle rotates, its position is essentially fixed at its pivot","[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

* **`magnetic_bar_direction` causes `needle_direction`**:  As the bar rotates, the needle rotates to align itself with the bar's magnetic field. This is a direct causal link.
* **`needle_position` does not cause anything**: The needle's starting position doesn't affect its final orientation or the bar's orientation. It only affects where the needle ends up pointing *to*, not which direction it *points in*.
* **`needle_direction` does not cause anything**: The needle reacting to the magnetic field doesn't influence the magnetic bar's orientation.


The animation clearly demonstrates that the needle follows the bar's magnetic field, regardless of its initial position. This confirms the causal link between `magnetic_bar_direction` and `needle_direction`.
