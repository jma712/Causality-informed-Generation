**Explanation:**

* **weight -> deformation:** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform.  A heavier weight causes more deformation, while a lighter weight causes less deformation.

* **deformation -/> spring_constant & deformation -/> weight:**  The deformation of the spring is an *effect* of the spring constant and the weight.  The deformation itself does *not* cause a change in the spring constant or the weight.  These are independent variables that influence the deformation (dependent variable).


The animation illustrates this by showing how changing the weight (wood block vs. lighter block) leads to different amounts of deformation on what we can assume is the same spring (hence, constant spring_constant).  The animation does not change the spring constant itself.

* **deformation -> spring_constant and deformation -> weight:** Deformation is an effect, not a cause.  The spring's deformation doesn't change its inherent stiffness (spring constant), nor does it alter the weight acting upon it.

**Explanation:**

* **weight -> spring_constant (1):**  Changing the weight placed on the spring *directly* influences how much the spring compresses. A heavier weight causes greater compression. While springs have an inherent spring constant, in this context, we observe how much the spring visually deforms. The visual deformation (our proxy for 'spring_constant') is directly affected by the weight. It's important to distinguish between the true, inherent spring constant (which is a property of the spring itself) and the observed deformation which we are calling spring_constant here.

* **weight -> deformation (1):** Increasing the weight causes more deformation (compression) of the spring. This is a direct causal link.

* **spring_constant -> deformation (1):** A higher observed 'spring constant' (meaning the spring appearing stiffer visually) results in less deformation for a given weight.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant → deformation:** A higher spring constant (stiffer spring) results in less deformation for the same weight.  A lower spring constant (looser spring) results in more deformation for the same weight.  This shows a clear causal link.

* **weight → deformation:** Increasing the weight placed on the spring causes it to deform more. Decreasing the weight causes less deformation. This is a direct causal relationship.

* **deformation → spring_constant/weight:** Deformation itself doesn't change the inherent properties of the spring (its constant) or the mass of the object (its weight). The spring constant is a property of the spring, and the weight is a property of the object. Therefore, there's no causal link from deformation back to these variables.

**Explanation:**

* **weight -> deformation (matrix[1][2] = 1):** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform.  A heavier weight causes more deformation, while a lighter weight causes less.

* **No other direct causal links:**  The spring constant and weight are independent variables. Changing the weight doesn't change the spring constant, and vice versa.  The deformation is the dependent variable, influenced by both weight and spring constant. It does not cause changes in either of them.  The animation makes it clear that weight and spring are external inputs and deformation is the result.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant --> deformation:** The spring constant (stiffness) directly influences how much the spring deforms under a given weight.  A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight.
* **weight --> deformation:** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform.  A heavier weight leads to greater deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same.
* **deformation does not cause spring_constant or weight:**  The amount the spring deforms is a *result* of the spring constant and the applied weight. It doesn't change the inherent properties of the spring (its constant) nor the mass of the object placed upon it.


The animation demonstrates how different weights (light grey vs. heavier brown) cause different amounts of deformation on the same spring (implying a constant spring constant).  It doesn't depict changes in the spring constant itself. Therefore, the causal direction is clear: spring_constant and weight cause deformation, not the other way around.

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant → deformation:** A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight.  A lower spring constant leads to greater deformation for the same weight.  This demonstrates a direct causal relationship.

* **weight → deformation:**  Increasing the weight placed on a spring causes greater deformation. Decreasing the weight results in less deformation.  This is another direct causal relationship.

* **deformation → spring_constant (0):** The deformation of the spring *does not* change the spring's inherent constant. The constant is a property of the spring itself.

* **deformation → weight (0):** The deformation of a spring doesn't change the weight applied to it.  The weight is an external force.


The animation helps visualize these relationships.  We see different weights and arguably different spring constants (though not explicitly labeled) leading to varying degrees of deformation","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant -> deformation:** The stiffness of the spring (spring_constant) directly influences how much it deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant will result in less deformation for the same weight.

* **weight -> deformation:** The amount of weight applied to the spring directly influences how much it deforms.  A heavier weight will cause more deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same.

* **deformation !-> spring_constant:**  Deformation does *not* cause a change in the spring constant. The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself.

* **deformation !-> weight:** Deformation does *not* cause a change in the weight. The weight is an independent variable.

* **spring_constant !-> weight and weight !-> spring_constant:** Spring constant and weight are independent of each other. Changing one does not directly influence the other.

**Explanation:**

Conversely, a lower spring constant (looser spring) results in *more* deformation for the same weight. This demonstrates a clear causal link where the spring constant influences the deformation.

* **weight → deformation:** A higher weight applied to the spring causes *more* deformation. A lower weight results in less deformation. This is a fundamental principle of how springs behave, establishing a direct causal relationship.


* **Deformation does not cause weight or spring constant**  The deformation of a spring is an effect, not a cause of the spring constant or the weight applied. Changing the deformation itself won't directly change the inherent stiffness of the spring or the mass of the object applying force.  It is only a consequence of these two properties working together.

Therefore, deformation is the effect, influenced by both spring constant and weight as causes.
