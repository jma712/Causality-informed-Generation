**Explanation:**

The animation demonstrates a classic lever system (seesaw).  The causal relationships are as follows:

* **`seesaw_left_arm` -> `seesaw_torque`:** The position (implicit in the animation as up/down state) and length of the left arm of the seesaw directly influences the net torque.  A longer left arm with weight will exert greater counter-clockwise torque.
* **`left_weight` -> `seesaw_torque`:** The weight on the left side directly affects the counter-clockwise torque.  More weight means more torque.

**Explanation:**

* **`seesaw_left_arm` (and `seesaw_right_arm`) → `seesaw_torque`:** The position of the weights on the left and right arms of the seesaw directly influence the torque (rotational force) applied to the seesaw's fulcrum (the central pivot point).  Moving a weight further out on the arm increases the leverage and thus the torque.  Therefore, the arm positions are causal factors for the resulting torque.

* **`left_weight` (and `right_weight`) → `seesaw_torque`:**  The weight placed on either side of the seesaw is another direct cause of the torque.

**Explanation:**

* **`seesaw_left_arm` → `seesaw_torque`**: The position (angle) of the left arm of the seesaw directly influences the torque. A lower left arm contributes to clockwise torque.

* **`left_weight` → `seesaw_torque`**: The weight on the left side directly influences the torque.  More weight on the left side increases the clockwise torque.

* **`seesaw_right_arm` → `seesaw_torque`**: The position (angle) of the right arm of the seesaw directly influences the torque.","[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

* **`left_weight` causes `seesaw_torque`:** Increasing the `left_weight` causes the seesaw to rotate counter-clockwise, increasing the torque in that direction.  Conversely, decreasing the `left_weight` reduces the counter-clockwise torque.

* **`right_weight` causes `seesaw_torque`:**  Increasing the `right_weight` causes the seesaw to rotate clockwise, increasing the torque in that direction.  Decreasing the `right_weight` reduces the clockwise torque.

* **`seesaw_left_arm` and `seesaw_right_arm` are fixed:** In this simplified scenario, we treat the arm lengths as fixed properties of the seesaw, not variables that change","[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

The seesaw's movement (represented by `seesaw_torque`) is a direct consequence of the following variables:

* **`seesaw_left_arm`**: The length of the left arm acts as a lever.  A longer left arm amplifies the effect of the left weight, contributing to the torque.
* **`left_weight`**:  The weight on the left side directly generates a downward force, creating torque around the fulcrum.
* **`seesaw_right_arm`**: Similar to the left arm, the right arm's length influences the","[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
