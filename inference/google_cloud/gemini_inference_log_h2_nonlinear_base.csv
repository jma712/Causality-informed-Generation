**Explanation:**

The animation shows one cylinder changing size (volume) while the other objects remain constant.  There's no indication that changing the volume of one cylinder affects the volume of the ball or vice-versa.  The changes in the cylinder's volume are externally driven (i.e., by some unobserved force or process), not caused by the ball's volume.  Similarly, the ball's volume stays constant regardless of what happens to the cylinder.  Therefore, there's no directly observable causal relationship between the two variables in this limited scenario.
