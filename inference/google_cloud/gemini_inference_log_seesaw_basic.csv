**Explanation:**

* **`left_weight` causes `seesaw_torque` and `seesaw_left_arm`:** Increasing the `left_weight` directly causes the seesaw to rotate (creating torque). It also defines the length of the `seesaw_left_arm` as the weight is essentially part of that arm.
* **`right_weight` causes `seesaw_torque` and `seesaw_right_arm`:**  Similar to the left side, increasing the `right_weight` causes the seesaw to rotate (creating torque) in the opposite direction. It also defines the length of the `seesaw_right_arm` for the same reason as the left side.

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

**Explanation of Causal Relationships:**

* **`left_weight` causes `seesaw_torque`:** Increasing the `left_weight` increases the counter-clockwise torque on the seesaw.  Decreasing the `left_weight` decreases the counter-clockwise torque. This is a direct causal relationship.

* **`right_weight` causes `seesaw_torque`:** Increasing the `right_weight` increases the clockwise torque on the seesaw. Decreasing the `right_weight` decreases the clockwise torque.  This is a direct causal relationship.

* **`seesaw_left_arm` and `seesaw_right_arm` are parameters, not causal variables in this context:** While the length of the arms *influ","[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

**Explanation:**

* **`left_weight` causes `seesaw_torque` (matrix[1][4] = 1):** Increasing the weight on the left side of the seesaw increases the torque (rotational force) pushing the left side down.
* **`right_weight` causes `seesaw_torque` (matrix[3][4] = 1):**  Similarly, increasing the weight on the right side increases the torque pushing the right side down.  Note that the torques oppose each other; their combined effect determines the net torque and thus which way the seesaw tips or if it balances.

The other variables do not directly *cause* changes in other variables in this simplified model.  The seesaw arms' lengths are assumed fixed (","[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
