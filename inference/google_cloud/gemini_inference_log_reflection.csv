**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate a clear causal relationship between the incident angle of light (incident_degree) and the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  As the incident angle changes, the reflection angle changes correspondingly. The reflection angle *depends* on the incident angle.

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:**  The angle of incidence directly causes the angle of reflection.  Changing the incident angle *forces* a change in the reflection angle according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).

* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** There's no indication that changing the reflection angle *directly* influences the incident angle. You can't manipulate the reflected light and expect the source light to change its angle.  The reflection is a *consequence* of the incident light, not the other way around.


Therefore, the matrix reflects a unidirectional causal link from incident_degree to reflection_degree.

The images demonstrate a clear causal relationship between the incident angle of a light beam (incident_degree) and the angle of the reflected beams (reflection_degree). 

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:**  As the incident angle changes (the single beam moving from vertical to angled), the reflection angle changes correspondingly (the split beams spreading wider).  This is a fundamental principle of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Therefore, manipulating the incident angle *causes* a change in the reflection angle.

* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** There's no indication that changing the reflection angle would influence the incident angle. The reflection is a *consequence* of the incident beam, not the other way around.  Thus, there is no causal link in this direction.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate the reflection of light. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  Therefore, changing the incident angle *causes* a change in the reflected angle.

Conversely, the angle of reflection does *not* cause a change in the angle of incidence.  The reflected light's path doesn't influence the incoming light's path.

Therefore:

* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** No causal relationship.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate a clear causal relationship between the incident angle of a light beam (incident_degree) and the angle of its reflection (reflection_degree).  The reflection angle *depends* on the incident angle.  When the incident angle changes, the reflection angle changes correspondingly.

Therefore:

* **incident_degree --> reflection_degree**:  The incident angle *causes* a change in the reflection angle. This is represented by a '1' in matrix[0][1].
* **reflection_degree --X--> incident_degree**:  The reflection angle does *not* cause a change in the incident angle. The reflection is a *consequence* of the incident beam. This is represented by a '0' in matrix[1][0].

The diagonal entries are '0' because a variable cannot directly cause itself in this context. Any change in a variable is due to an external factor (like the incident angle's change driven by an unseen hand or mechanism).

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate the principle of reflection. The angle of incidence (the angle between the incoming light ray and the surface normal) directly influences the angle of reflection (the angle between the reflected light ray and the surface normal).  Changing the incident angle *causes* a corresponding change in the reflection angle. There is no mechanism by which the reflection angle can influence the incident angle in this setup.

Therefore:

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:**  A causal relationship exists where the incident degree causes the reflection degree.  Represented by a '1' in the matrix.
* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** No direct causal relationship exists in this direction. Represented by a '0' in the matrix.
* **Self-loops (diagonal entries):** We assume no direct self-causation for these basic physical properties within the context of this demonstration. Therefore, the diagonal entries are '0'.
