Based on the variables and relationships in a seesaw system, the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships is as follows:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on the left side
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on the right side
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # Length of arm of force on the right side
]
```

### Explanation of the relationships:
- The mass and length of the arm of the force on the left side directly influence the direction of inclination of the seesaw.
- The mass and length of the arm of force on the right side do not directly affect the left side's parameters in this context.
