Based on the relationships among the variables described, the causal relationships can be represented in an adjacency matrix format. Hereâ€™s the matrix representing the causal relationships related to the seesaw system:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],  # Mass of weight on left
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Length of arm on left
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Mass of weight on right
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm on right
]
```

### Explanation:
- The first row indicates that both the mass and length of the left side ar arm affect the direction of inclination.
- The second and third rows show that the mass of the left weight and its distance can influence the mass on the right and arm length, respectively.
- The mass on the right affects the direction of the seesaw but does not influence the other aspects.
