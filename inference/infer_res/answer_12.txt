Based on the causal relationships among the variables related to a seesaw system, the adjacency matrix representing these relationships is as follows:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The direction of inclination of the seesaw
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The mass of the weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The length of the arm of force on the left side
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # The mass of the weight on the right side
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # The length of the arm of force on the right side
]
```

### Explanation:
- The mass and length of the arm of force on the left side both influence the direction of inclination of the seesaw.
- The mass and length of the arm of force on the right side also have a causal influence on the direction of inclination. 

There are no feedback loops in this simple mechanical system as described.
