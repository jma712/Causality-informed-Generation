To represent the causal relationships among the provided variables related to a seesaw system, I will outline the interactions based on physics principles.

The relevant variables are:

1. The direction of inclination of the seesaw (D)
2. The mass of the weight on the left side (M_L)
3. The length of the arm of force on the left side (L_L)
4. The mass of the weight on the right side (M_R)
5. The length of the arm of force on the right side (L_R)

Based on how these variables interact, we can outline the following relationships:

- The direction of inclination (D) is affected by the torques produced by the weights (M_L, M_R) acting at specified distances (L_L, L_R).
- The mass of the left weight (M_L) influences the left torque.
- The length of the arm of force on the left (L_L) also influences the left torque.
- Similarly, the mass of the right weight (M_R) and the length of the arm of force on the right (L_R) contribute to the right torque.

Thus, we can summarize the causal relationships as follows:
- \( D \) is influenced by \( M_L, L_L, M_R, L_R \).
- \( M_L \) and \( L_L \) influence the left side torque.
- \( M_R \) and \( L_R \) influence the right side torque.

### Adjacency Matrix
Using these relationships, we can create the adjacency matrix:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # D influences M_L, L_L, M_R, L_R
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # M_L does not influence others
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # L_L does not influence others
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # M_R does not influence others
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # L_R does not influence others
]
```

The matrix indicates that the direction of inclination \( D \) has causal links to all other variables, while the other variables do not influence \( D \) or each other.
