Based on the relationships among the given variables in a seesaw system, here's the adjacency matrix in a Python 2D list format:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 1. Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 2. Mass of weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 3. Length of arm of force on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 4. Mass of weight on the right side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # 5. Length of arm of force on the right side
]
```

### Explanation:
- The direction of inclination is influenced by all the other variables (mass and length of the arms on both sides).
- The mass of weights and lengths of arms act as direct contributors to the balance and inclination of the seesaw. 
- No variables affect each other independently without impacting the direction of inclination.
