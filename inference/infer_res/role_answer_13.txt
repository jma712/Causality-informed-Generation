Based on the relationships among the provided variables related to the seesaw system, here is the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # Direction of inclination influences mass and length on both sides
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],  # Mass of weight on left side influences direction and right side mass and length
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],  # Length of arm on left side influences direction and right side mass and length
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Mass of weight on right side influences direction and right length
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # Length of arm on right side influences direction but not the others directly
]
``` 

This matrix illustrates the causal influence of each variable on the others according to the principles of torque and balancing forces in a seesaw system.
