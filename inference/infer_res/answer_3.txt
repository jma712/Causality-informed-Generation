Here's the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships among the specified variables of the seesaw system:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on right side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on right side
]
```

### Explanation of the Matrix:
- Rows and columns represent the variables in the following order:
  1. Direction of inclination
  2. Mass of the weight on the left side
  3. Length of the arm of force on the left side
  4. Mass of the weight on the right side
  5. Length of the arm of force on the right side

- The matrix indicates that:
  - The masses and lengths on each side influence the direction of inclination (hence the '1's in the respective rows).
