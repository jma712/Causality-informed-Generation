Based on the provided variables related to a seesaw system, hereâ€™s the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships among these variables:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # The direction of inclination influences all other variables
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The mass of the weight on the left side does not influence anything else
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The length of the arm of force on the left side does not influence anything else
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The mass of the weight on the right side does not influence anything else
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The length of the arm of force on the right side does not influence anything else
]
```

### Explanation of Relationships:
1. **Direction of Inclination**: This variable is influenced by the masses and lengths of the arms on either side, hence the directed edges.
2. **Other Variables**: The masses and lengths of the arms do not directly influence the other variables in a feedback loop; their effect is captured in the inclination.
