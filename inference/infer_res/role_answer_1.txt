Based on the relationships among the provided variables in the seesaw system, here is the adjacency matrix:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 1. Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # 2. Mass of the weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 3. Length of the arm of force on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 4. Mass of the weight on the right side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 5. Length of the arm of force on the right side
]
```

### Explanation:
- The first row indicates that the direction of inclination is influenced by the weights and their arm lengths.
- The second and subsequent rows indicate that the left and right weights and their arm lengths impact the seesaw's overall behavior.
