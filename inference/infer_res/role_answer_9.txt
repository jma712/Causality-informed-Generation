Based on the relationships between the variables in the seesaw system, the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships is as follows:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 1. Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # 2. Mass of weight on left
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 3. Length of arm of force on left
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # 4. Mass of weight on right
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 5. Length of arm of force on right
]
```

### Explanation of Entries:
- Each row/column corresponds to the variables in the specified order.
- A `1` indicates a causal relationship, while a `0` indicates no direct relationship.
- For example, the mass and length of the arms on both sides influence the direction of inclination (hence the corresponding entries).
