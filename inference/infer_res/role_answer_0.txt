Based on the relationships among the variables in the seesaw system, the causal relationships can be represented in an adjacency matrix as follows:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The direction of inclination of the seesaw
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # The mass of the weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # The length of the arm of force on the left side
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # The mass of the weight on the right side
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # The length of the arm of force on the right side
]
```

### Explanation
- The entries in the matrix indicate a causal influence (1 means causal influence exists; 0 means no influence).
- The mass and length of the arm on either side affect the seesaw's direction of inclination and each other's side accordingly.
