Here's the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships among the variables related to the seesaw system:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on left 
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on left
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Mass of weight on right
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Length of arm of force on right
]
```

In this matrix:
- The rows correspond to the variables in the order listed.
- A value of `1` indicates a direct causal influence, while `0` indicates no direct influence.
