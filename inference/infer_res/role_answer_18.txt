Here is the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships among the variables related to the seesaw system:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination of the seesaw
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Mass of the weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of the arm of force on the left side
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Mass of the weight on the right side
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Length of the arm of force on the right side
]
``` 

Each row and column corresponds to the variables in the order they were listed. The entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a direct causal relationship.
