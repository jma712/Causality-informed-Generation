Based on the seesaw system's variables and relationships, here's the adjacency matrix representing the causal relationships:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on the left
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on the left
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on the right
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]   # Length of arm of force on the right
]
```

### Explanation of the Matrix:
- **Rows and Columns**: Each row and column corresponds to the respective variables listed in order.
- **Causal Relationships**:
  - The mass and length of arms on both sides influence the direction of inclination, hence the values in the first row. All relevant variables can impact it.
  - Only the left-side mass and length directly influence the adjustment of the seesaw. 

This representation captures the key causal relationships present in a seesaw system.
