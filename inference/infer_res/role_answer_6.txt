Based on the relationships among the given variables for the seesaw system, here is the causal adjacency matrix represented as a Python 2D list:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Mass of weight on the left side
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Length of arm of force on the left side
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],  # Mass of weight on the right side
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]   # Length of arm of force on the right side
]
```

In this matrix:
- A "1" indicates a causal relationship, while a "0" indicates no direct causal relationship.
- Each row and column corresponds to the variables in the order specified.
