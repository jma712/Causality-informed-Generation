To determine the causal relationships among the variables related to a seesaw system, we can represent the potential relationships in an adjacency matrix format. The variables are as follows:

1. The direction of inclination of the seesaw.
2. The mass of the weight on the left side.
3. The length of the arm of force on the left side.
4. The mass of the weight on the right side.
5. The length of the arm of force on the right side.

From these variables, we can infer the following causal relationships:

- The direction of inclination of the seesaw depends on the weights and their distances from the pivot point (torque).
- The mass of the weight on the left side and its length affect the torque on the left side.
- The mass of the weight on the right side and its length affect the torque on the right side.

Based on these relationships, the adjacency matrix can be constructed as follows:

```python
adjacency_matrix = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 1. Direction of inclination
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 2. Mass on left affects direction
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # 3. Length on left affects direction and mass
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 4. Mass on right affects direction
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]   # 5. Length on right affects direction and mass
]
```

- **Rows represent the variables affecting the columns.**
- A value of `1` indicates a causal relationship, while `0` indicates no causal relationship.
