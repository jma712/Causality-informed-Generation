**Explanation:**

The images show a red ball and a green cube.  While their sizes change over different images, there's no indication that the volume of one influences the other.

**Explanation:**

The provided video shows a static scene with a red ball and a green cube.  There is no change in the size or volume of either object. Because there is no variation or intervention observed, we cannot infer *any* causal relationship between the ball's volume and the cube's volume.  They simply co-exist.  No change in one is associated with a change in the other. Therefore, all entries in the adjacency matrix are 0.

**Explanation:**

The provided images show a red ball and a green cube. While their sizes change independently throughout the frames, there's no evidence to suggest that the volume of one influences the volume of the other.  They appear to be completely unrelated. Therefore, all entries in the adjacency matrix are 0, indicating no direct causal relationships.

**Explanation:**

The provided image sequence shows a red ball and a green cube. While their sizes change independently throughout the sequence, there's no indication that one object's volume change *causes* the other to change. The variations appear unrelated.  Therefore, there's no causal link between the ball's volume and the cube's volume.  Both objects' size changes seem to be caused by some external, unseen factor (likely the animator of the scene), rather than influencing each other.
