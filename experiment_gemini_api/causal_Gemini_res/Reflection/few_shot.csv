Complete the causality adjacency matrix based on the identified relationships and briefly explain your conclusions.Example 1:
To determine the causal relationships, we can consider the principles of projectile motion and springs. Here's a possible breakdown:

1. **Deformation of spring**: The more a spring is compressed (or stretched), the more energy is stored, affecting the speed of the object when released, which in turn influences the height and horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle affects the trajectory, which determines both the height and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle but doesn‚Äôt directly affect any other variables in this context.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle.

Using these insights, a possible causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- **Deformation of spring** causes emergence angle, height of highest point, and horizontal distance due to the initial speed provided by the spring.
- **Emergence angle** directly affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance (as it determines the projectile's trajectory).
- **Height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** do not cause changes in other variables in this scenario.

Example 2:
To determine the causality adjacency matrix, consider the relationship between the forces applied on either side of the seesaw and its moment or tilt. Changes in `left_force` and `right_force` can directly influence the `Seesaw Moment`, deciding which side tilts.
Here's the filled matrix:
```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- `left_force` and `right_force` affect the `Seesaw Moment` by altering the balance; hence both have a direct causal relationship to the tilt.
- The `Seesaw Moment` (tilt) does not directly cause changes in either `left_force` or `right_force`; rather it is a result of the two forces.

Example 3:
To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, we need to assess the potential causal relationships between the variables based on the images and scenario. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Ball volume** affects **water height in the cup**. The larger the ball, the higher the water level.
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** affects **water height in the cup**. A narrower bottom may cause water to rise higher.
3. **Water height in the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher water levels can increase flow length due to increased pressure.
4. **Hole height on the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher holes might result in stronger flows.

The proposed causality adjacency matrix could look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Ball volume (1) causes water height (3)**: The presence of the ball displaces water, raising its level.
- **Diameter of the bottom of the cup (2) causes water height (3)**: The shape of the cup can impact the water height due to displacement being more noticeable in narrow containers.
- **Water height (3) causes length of water flow (5)**: With more water height, there's greater pressure, which can lead to a longer water stream.
- **Hole height (4) causes length of water flow (5)**: The height of the hole affects the pressure and thus the flow's distance.

### Explanation:

The **incident_degree (angle of incidence)** directly causes the **reflection_degree (angle of reflection)**.  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  A change in the incident angle *causes* a corresponding change in the reflection angle.

The **reflection_degree** does *not* cause the **incident_degree**. The angle of reflection is a *consequence* of the incident angle, not the other way around.

Example 3:
To determine the causal relationships between the spring constant, weight, and deformation of the spring, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the deformation (displacement) of the spring, given by:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer:

1. **spring_constant** (\( k \)) affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): If the spring constant increases, for the same weight, the deformation decreases.
2. **weight** affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): An increase in weight causes more deformation.

**Explanation:**

The incident angle (incident_degree) directly determines the reflection angle (reflection_degree) according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). Therefore, a change in the incident angle *causes* a change in the reflection angle.

The reflection angle does not cause any change in the incident angle. The reflected ray's direction is a *consequence* of the incident ray's angle, not the other way around.  There's no physical mechanism by which the reflection would change the incoming light's direction.

This matrix assumes no direct causations between other combinations of variables based on typical fluid mechanics.

Example 2:
To determine the causal relationships between the spring constant, weight, and deformation of the spring, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the deformation (displacement) of the spring, given by:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer:

1. **spring_constant** (\( k \)) affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): If the spring constant increases, for the same weight, the deformation decreases.
2. **weight** affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): An increase in weight causes more deformation.
3. The **spring_constant** (\( k \)) and **weight** do not directly affect each other.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- Element (1,3) is 1 because the spring constant affects deformation.
- Element (2,3) is 1 because the weight affects deformation.
- The other entries are 0 because there is no direct causal relationship otherwise.

Example 3:
To determine the causal relationships, we can consider the principles of projectile motion and springs. Here's a possible breakdown:

1. **Deformation of spring**: The more a spring is compressed (or stretched), the more energy is stored, affecting the speed of the object when released, which in turn influences the height and horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle affects the trajectory, which determines both the height and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle but doesn‚Äôt directly affect any other variables in this context.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle.

Using these insights, a possible causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- **Deformation of spring** causes emergence angle, height of highest point, and horizontal distance due to the initial speed provided by the spring.
- **Emergence angle** directly affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance (as it determines the projectile's trajectory).
- **Height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** do not cause changes in other variables in this scenario.

**Explanation:**

The **incident_degree** (the angle at which the light ray hits the mirror) directly causes the **reflection_degree** (the angle at which the light ray reflects off the mirror).  The law of reflection dictates that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  Therefore, changing the incident angle will directly change the reflection angle.

The **reflection_degree** cannot cause the **incident_degree**. The reflection is a consequence of the incident ray and the mirror's properties.  The reflected ray doesn't influence how the incoming ray strikes the mirror.

Complete the causality adjacency matrix based on the identified relationships and briefly explain your conclusions.Example 1:
To determine the causal relationships, we can consider the principles of projectile motion and springs. Here's a possible breakdown:

1. **Deformation of spring**: The more a spring is compressed (or stretched), the more energy is stored, affecting the speed of the object when released, which in turn influences the height and horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle affects the trajectory, which determines both the height and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle but doesn‚Äôt directly affect any other variables in this context.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is determined by the initial speed and angle.

Using these insights, a possible causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- **Deformation of spring** causes emergence angle, height of highest point, and horizontal distance due to the initial speed provided by the spring.
- **Emergence angle** directly affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance (as it determines the projectile's trajectory).
- **Height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** do not cause changes in other variables in this scenario.

Example 2:
To determine the causal relationships between the spring constant, weight, and deformation of the spring, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the deformation (displacement) of the spring, given by:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer:

1. **spring_constant** (\( k \)) affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): If the spring constant increases, for the same weight, the deformation decreases.
2. **weight** affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): An increase in weight causes more deformation.
3. The **spring_constant** (\( k \)) and **weight** do not directly affect each other.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- Element (1,3) is 1 because the spring constant affects deformation.
- Element (2,3) is 1 because the weight affects deformation.
- The other entries are 0 because there is no direct causal relationship otherwise.

Example 3:
To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, we need to assess the potential causal relationships between the variables based on the images and scenario. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Ball volume** affects **water height in the cup**. The larger the ball, the higher the water level.
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** affects **water height in the cup**. A narrower bottom may cause water to rise higher.
3. **Water height in the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher water levels can increase flow length due to increased pressure.
4. **Hole height on the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher holes might result in stronger flows.

The proposed causality adjacency matrix could look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Ball volume (1) causes water height (3)**: The presence of the ball displaces water, raising its level.
- **Diameter of the bottom of the cup (2) causes water height (3)**: The shape of the cup can impact the water height due to displacement being more noticeable in narrow containers.
- **Water height (3) causes length of water flow (5)**: With more water height, there's greater pressure, which can lead to a longer water stream.
- **Hole height (4) causes length of water flow (5)**: The height of the hole affects the pressure and thus the flow's distance.

This matrix assumes no direct causations between other combinations of variables based on typical fluid mechanics.

Based on the examples above, answer the following questions:
There are 2 variables: 
1. incident_degree
2. reflection_degree
.
Please fill this causality adjacency matrix:
```
[[_, _],
 [_, _],]
```.
In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","```
[[0, 1],
 [0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

The incident angle (the angle at which the light hits the surface) directly determines the reflection angle (the angle at which the light bounces off).  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  Therefore, changing the incident angle *causes* the reflection angle to change.  The reverse is not true; changing the reflection angle won't magically change the incident angle.
