In the animation, we see the beams converge when incident_degree decreases, and diverge as it increases. The reflection beams perfectly mirror this motion as dictated by the law of reflection, confirming the causal link.

**Explanation:**

The animation demonstrates the principle of reflection. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) is the angle between the incoming light ray and the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). The angle of reflection (reflection_degree) is the angle between the reflected light ray and the normal.

The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  This means the incident angle *determines* the reflected angle.  Therefore, the incident_degree causes the reflection_degree.  Changing the incident angle directly causes a change in the reflected angle.

However, the reflection_degree does *not* cause the incident_degree. The reflected angle cannot dictate the incoming angle. Changing the reflected angle by some other means (e.g., manipulating the mirror after the reflection) would not change the original incident angle.


Therefore:

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:** Causal relationship (1)
* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** No direct causal relationship (0)

**Explanation:**

The **incident_degree** (the angle at which the light rays hit the surface) directly influences the **reflection_degree** (the angle at which the light rays reflect off the surface). This is a fundamental principle of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

Conversely, the **reflection_degree** cannot cause a change in the **incident_degree**.  The reflection is a *consequence* of the incident angle, not the other way around. The light source determines the incident angle, and the surface's properties (in this case, assumed to be perfect reflection) determine how the light reflects based on that incident angle.

**Explanation:**

The animation clearly demonstrates that the angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  When the incident angle changes, the reflected angle changes correspondingly.  The reflection angle is *dependent* on the incident angle.

Therefore:

* **incident_degree causes reflection_degree:**  matrix[0][1] = 1
* **reflection_degree does not cause incident_degree:** matrix[1][0] = 0
Neither variable causes itself, so the diagonal entries are 0.

**Explanation:**

The incident degree (the angle at which the light ray hits the surface) directly causes the reflection degree (the angle at which the light ray reflects).  Changing the angle of incidence directly changes the angle of reflection according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).

The reflection degree *cannot* cause the incident degree. The angle of reflection is a *consequence* of the incident angle. Changing the angle of the reflected ray won't magically change the incoming ray's angle.  Therefore, there's a unidirectional causal relationship from incident degree to reflection degree.

**Explanation:**

The incident angle (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of reflection (reflection_degree). This is a fundamental law of reflection in physics: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  Changing the incident angle *causes* the reflection angle to change correspondingly.

However, the reverse is not true. Changing the reflection angle does *not* cause a change in the incident angle. The reflection angle is a *consequence* of the incident angle, not a cause.  Therefore:

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:** Causal relationship (1)
* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** No direct causal relationship (0)

**Explanation:**

The incident angle of the light beams (incident_degree) directly influences the angle at which they are reflected (reflection_degree). The angle of reflection is dependent upon the angle of incidence according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).  Therefore, changing the incident angle *causes* a change in the reflected angle.

Conversely, the reflection angle does not cause a change in the incident angle. The incident angle is determined by the original direction of the light beams, independent of how they reflect.

**Explanation:**

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:** The angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly determines the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Changing the incident angle *causes* the reflected angle to change correspondingly.

* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** The angle of reflection does *not* cause the angle of incidence. The reflection is a *consequence* of the incident light, not the other way around.  The incident light exists independently of the reflection.


The animation clearly shows that manipulating the incident beams alters the reflected beams, demonstrating the causal relationship.

**Explanation:**

The **incident_degree** (the angle at which the light beams hit the surface) directly influences the **reflection_degree** (the angle at which the light beams reflect).  Changing the angle of incidence will cause a corresponding change in the angle of reflection.

However, the angle of reflection does not cause a change in the angle of incidence. The reflection is a *consequence* of the incidence, not the other way around. Therefore:

* **incident_degree** causes **reflection_degree**: matrix[0][1] = 1
* **reflection_degree** does not cause **incident_degree**: matrix[1][0] = 0
* A variable cannot directly cause itself: matrix[0][0] = 0 and matrix[1][1] = 0.
