**Explanation:**

The animation demonstrates the principle of reflection. The angle of the incident light (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of the reflected light (reflection_degree). Changing the incident angle causes the reflected angle to change correspondingly.  Therefore, incident_degree causes reflection_degree.

Conversely, changing the reflection angle *does not* cause the incident angle to change.  The reflected angle is a consequence of the incident angle and the reflective surface, not the other way around.

Thus, there is a causal link from incident_degree to reflection_degree, but not vice-versa.

**Explanation:**

The animation clearly demonstrates that changing the incident angle of the light (incident_degree) directly affects the angle at which the light reflects (reflection_degree).  The reflection angle changes *because* the incident angle changes.  This establishes a causal link from incident_degree to reflection_degree.

Conversely, there's no indication that the reflection angle influences the incident angle. The reflection is a consequence of the incident light, not the other way around. Therefore, there's no causal link from reflection_degree to incident_degree.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate the principle of reflection. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) is the angle between the incoming light ray and the surface normal. The angle of reflection (reflection_degree) is the angle between the reflected light ray and the surface normal.  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

This implies a direct causal relationship where the incident_degree determines the reflection_degree. Changing the incident angle directly causes the reflection angle to change correspondingly.  The reverse is not true; changing the reflection angle does *not* cause the incident angle to change.  Therefore:

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree:**  Causal relationship exists.  (matrix[0][1] = 1)
* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree:** No direct causal relationship. (matrix[1][0] = 0)
Neither variable can cause itself, so the diagonal entries are 0.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate a light beam (or beams) reflecting off a surface. The angle of incidence is the angle between the incoming light beam and the surface normal (imaginary line perpendicular to the surface). The angle of reflection is the angle between the reflected light beam and the surface normal.

The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  This implies a direct causal relationship where the incident angle *determines* the reflected angle. Changing the incident angle *causes* the reflected angle to change accordingly. The reverse is not true; manipulating the reflected angle directly is not physically possible in this setup. The reflected angle is a *consequence* of the incident angle.

Therefore:

* **incident_degree --> reflection_degree**:  A change in the incident angle causes a change in the reflected angle.
* **reflection_degree --> incident_degree**: There's no causal link in this direction.  The reflected angle does not cause the incident angle to change.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate a simple reflection scenario. A ray of light (incident ray) strikes a reflective surface at a certain angle (incident_degree).  The ray then bounces off the surface at another angle (reflection_degree). The law of reflection dictates that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  

Therefore, the angle at which the incident ray strikes the surface *determines* the angle at which it reflects. This signifies a direct causal link from `incident_degree` to `reflection_degree`.  Changing the incident angle *causes* a change in the reflected angle.

Conversely, the reflection angle does not influence the incident angle.  The reflective surface doesn't somehow alter the incoming ray's angle *before* it hits the surface. Therefore, there's no causal relationship from `reflection_degree` to `incident_degree`.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate the principle of reflection. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) is the angle between the incoming light ray and the normal (perpendicular) to the reflective surface. The angle of reflection (reflection_degree) is the angle between the reflected light ray and the normal.  The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

This means that changing the incident_degree *causes* the reflection_degree to change correspondingly.  Therefore, incident_degree -> reflection_degree. There is no causal relationship in the other direction; changing the angle of reflection does not influence the angle of incidence. Hence, the matrix is as shown above.

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate a classic reflection scenario. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  The angle of reflection is *dependent* on the angle of incidence.  Changing the angle of incidence will cause the angle of reflection to change correspondingly.

Conversely, changing the angle of reflection does not influence the angle of incidence.  There's no physical mechanism by which manipulating the reflected light ray could change the incoming light ray's angle.

Therefore:

* **incident_degree -> reflection_degree**: Causal relationship exists.
* **reflection_degree -> incident_degree**: No causal relationship.

**Explanation:**

The animation clearly demonstrates that the angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly influences the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  As the incident angle changes, the reflection angle changes correspondingly, obeying the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection).

There's no indication that the reflection angle can influence the incident angle. The incident light ray's angle is determined independently of how it reflects. Therefore, the causal relationship is unidirectional, flowing from incident_degree to reflection_degree.

Your objective is to analyze the provided images and identify any causal relationships between the variables. Use the identified relationships to complete the causality adjacency matrix and provide a brief explanation supporting your conclusions.There are 2 variables: 
1. incident_degree
2. reflection_degree
.
Please fill this causality adjacency matrix:
```
[[_, _],
 [_, _],]
```.
In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","```
[[0, 1],
 [0, 0],]
```

**Explanation:**

The images demonstrate the principle of reflection. The angle of incidence (incident_degree) directly determines the angle of reflection (reflection_degree).  Changing the incident angle causes the reflected angle to change correspondingly.  However, changing the reflection angle does *not* cause the incident angle to change.  Therefore, the causal relationship flows from incident_degree to reflection_degree, and not the other way around.
