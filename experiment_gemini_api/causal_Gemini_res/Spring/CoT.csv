1. **spring_constant (k) and weight (w) do not directly influence each other.**  The material properties of the spring determine k, and the mass of the object determines w. These are independent variables.

2. **spring_constant (k) and deformation (x) have a causal relationship.** A higher spring constant (stiffer spring) will result in *less* deformation for a given weight.  However, the spring constant itself doesn't *change* because of the deformation. So, k causes x.

3. **weight (w) and deformation (x) have a causal relationship.**  A larger weight causes a *larger* deformation of the spring.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant causes deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't directly cause the other two
```

**Explanation:**

The video demonstrates Hooke's Law. The deformation (x) is the *effect*, and both the spring constant (k) and the weight (w) are *causes*.  Changing either k or w will change x. However, changing x will not change the inherent k of the spring nor the w of the object.  Therefore, the causal relationship is unidirectional from k and w to x.

**Causal Relationships:**

1. **spring_constant** and **weight** cause **deformation of spring**: The deformation of the spring is directly influenced by both the spring constant and the weight applied to it.  A higher spring constant will result in less deformation for the same weight.  A higher weight will result in more deformation for the same spring constant.  Hooke's Law expresses this relationship mathematically: F = -kx  where 'F' represents force (proportional to weight), 'k' is the spring constant and 'x' is the displacement (deformation).

2. **weight** does not cause **spring_constant**: The weight attached to a spring does not inherently change the spring's stiffness or its intrinsic spring constant. The spring constant is a property of the spring itself (material, coil thickness etc.).

3. **spring_constant** does not cause **weight**:  The spring constant, a property of the spring, doesn't influence the weight of the attached object.  The weight is an independent property.

4. **deformation of spring** does not cause **weight**: Although the spring deforms under the weight, the deformation itself doesn't change the weight of the object.

5. **deformation of spring** does not cause **spring_constant**:  Stretching or compressing the spring within its elastic limit does not change its spring constant.


**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],

```

**Explanation:**

Row 1 represents `spring_constant`. The 1 in column 3 indicates it causes `deformation of spring`.

Row 2 represents `weight`. The 1 in column 3 indicates it causes `deformation of spring`.

Row 3 represents `deformation of spring`.  All zeros indicate it doesn't directly cause any of the other variables.

**Causal Relationships:**

1. **spring_constant and weight → deformation of spring:** The deformation (stretch or compression) of a spring is determined by both its spring constant (stiffness) and the weight (force) applied to it. A higher spring constant means less deformation for a given weight. A larger weight causes more deformation for a given spring constant. This is a direct causal link.

2. **deformation of spring → spring_constant & weight**:  The deformation itself *does not* cause changes to either the spring constant or the weight.  The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring, and the weight is an external force.

**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (spring_constant):**  `[0, 0, 1]` - The spring constant doesn't influence the weight (0), but it does influence the deformation (1).
* **Row 2 (weight):** `[0, 0, 1]` - The weight doesn't influence the spring constant (0), but it does influence the deformation (1).
* **Row 3 (deformation of spring):** `[0, 0, 0]` - The deformation doesn't directly influence either the spring constant (0) or the weight (0).


The visualization likely shows different spring constants (represented by the different two-colored bars) and different weights (possibly represented by the smaller triangular object), leading to different levels of spring deformation.  This further illustrates that the spring constant and weight are independent variables causing the deformation, which is the dependent variable.

* **Row 3 (deformation):** All zeros. The deformation is the effect, not a cause. While related to weight and spring constant, it doesn't cause a change in either of those.  It is important to distinguish between correlation and causality. Although the deformation is *related* to weight and spring constant, it is not a *cause* of them, it is an *effect*.

**Causal Relationships:**

1. **spring_constant (k) and weight (w) do NOT influence each other directly.**  The spring constant is a property of the spring itself, and the weight is a property of the attached mass.  Changing one doesn't directly cause a change in the other.

2. **spring_constant (k) and weight (w) BOTH influence the deformation (x) of the spring.** Hooke's Law states: F = -kx, where F is the force applied (in this case, the weight), k is the spring constant, and x is the deformation.  A higher weight (greater force) will cause more deformation.  A higher spring constant will result in less deformation for the same applied force.

3. **Deformation (x) does NOT cause a change in spring_constant (k) or weight (w).**  The deformation is a *result* of the interaction between the spring's properties and the applied force.

The matrix representation clearly shows that the spring constant and the weight are independent variables that both have a causal effect on the dependent variable, the spring's deformation. The deformation itself does not cause changes in the spring constant or the weight.

**Step-by-step Thought Process:**

1. **Spring Constant (k):** The spring constant is an intrinsic property of the spring itself. It determines how stiff the spring is. It's not *caused* by any of the other variables in this scenario.

2. **Weight (W):** The weight applied to the spring is an external force. It's independent of the spring's deformation or the spring constant.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** The amount the spring deforms (stretches or compresses) is a *result* of both the weight applied to it *and* the spring's inherent stiffness (spring constant). A larger weight causes more deformation, and a stiffer spring (higher spring constant) causes less deformation for the same weight.

**Thinking step-by-step:**

1. **Spring Constant (k):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It's a measure of its stiffness.  It doesn't depend on the weight applied or the deformation.

2. **Weight (w):** The weight is an external force applied to the spring.  It can *cause* the spring to deform.

3. **Deformation (x):** The deformation of the spring is the *result* of the weight applied and the spring's inherent stiffness (spring constant).  The deformation doesn't cause changes in either the weight or the spring constant.

 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause spring constant or weight
```

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant -> weight (0):**  The stiffness of the spring doesn't influence how much an object weighs.
* **spring_constant -> deformation (0):** While the spring constant affects *how much* the spring deforms for a given weight, it doesn't directly *cause* deformation. Deformation needs a force (the weight) to be applied.
* **weight -> spring_constant (0):** Hanging a weight on a spring doesn't change the inherent stiffness of the spring.
* **weight -> deformation (1):**  Applying weight (a force) to the spring *causes* it to deform (stretch or compress).
* **deformation -> spring_constant (0):**  Stretching or compressing the spring doesn't change its spring constant.
* **deformation -> weight (0):**  The deformation of the spring doesn't change the weight of the object hanging from it.

2. **weight:** The weight is an external force applied to the spring.  It's not caused by the spring constant or the deformation.

3. **deformation:** The deformation (how much the spring stretches or compresses) is a direct result of *both* the weight applied *and* the spring constant. A heavier weight will cause more deformation. A higher spring constant (stiffer spring) will cause less deformation for the same weight.

* **Row 2 (weight):** Similar to the spring constant, the weight is independent and doesn't depend on the other variables. The second row is all zeros.
* **Row 3 (deformation):**  The deformation is influenced by *both* the spring constant and the weight.  Hence,  matrix[2][0] = 1 (spring_constant causes deformation) and matrix[2][1] = 1 (weight causes deformation).

1. **Spring Constant (k):**  The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It represents the stiffness of the spring and is independent of any external factors like weight or deformation.  Therefore, the spring constant *does not* cause changes in weight or deformation.

2. **Weight (W):**  The weight attached to the spring is an external force. When attached, it *causes* the spring to deform. However, the weight itself is not affected by either the spring constant or the deformation.  (Gravity determines weight, not spring properties).

3. **Deformation (x):**  The deformation of the spring is a *result* of the weight applied to it and the spring's inherent stiffness (spring constant).  So, both the spring constant and the weight *cause* deformation.  The deformation does not cause changes in the weight or the spring constant.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0],]
```

Where:
- Row 1: Spring Constant (k)
- Row 2: Weight (w)
- Row 3: Deformation (x)

**Explanation:**

The matrix shows a unidirectional causal relationship: weight causes deformation. The spring constant also plays a role in determining the deformation, as a stiffer spring (higher k) will deform less for the same weight. However, since the spring constant doesn't change in the provided images, the core causal relationship observed is between the weight applied and the resulting deformation of the spring.

2. **Weight (W):** The weight applied to the spring is an external force. It is independent of the spring constant and is a cause of the spring's deformation.

3. **Deformation (x):**  The deformation (how much the spring stretches or compresses) is a *result* of both the weight applied and the spring constant. A larger weight will cause a larger deformation, while a larger spring constant (stiffer spring) will resist deformation and result in a smaller deformation for the same weight.

 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause changes in spring constant or weight
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (Spring Constant):** The spring constant is independent. It doesn't change as a result of the other variables, and it doesn't directly cause changes in the other variables. Its value is pre-determined for a given spring.
* **Row 2 (Weight):**  Weight directly causes deformation. Changing the weight will change the deformation.
* **Row 3 (Deformation):** Deformation is an effect, not a cause. It is determined by the weight and spring constant.


It's important to note that the relationship between these variables is governed by Hooke's Law: F = -kx, where F is the force (weight), k is the spring constant, and x is the deformation.  This equation shows that deformation is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the spring constant.  However, causality is different from correlation. While the variables are mathematically related, the weight *causes* the deformation, given a spring's inherent stiffness (k).  The deformation isn't causing the weight to change.

A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight, while a larger weight results in more deformation for a given spring constant.

* **weight (1) does not cause spring_constant (0):** The weight attached to a spring does not change the inherent stiffness of the spring itself. The spring constant is a property of the spring's material and construction.

**Thought Process:**

1. **Spring Constant (k):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself.  It's a measure of how stiff the spring is.  It doesn't change based on the weight applied or the deformation.

2. **Weight (w):**  The weight attached to the spring is an independent variable.  It's an external force applied to the spring.

3. **Deformation (x):** The deformation of the spring (how much it stretches or compresses) is a *result* of both the spring constant and the weight applied. A larger weight causes more deformation, and a larger spring constant resists deformation.

**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 0],  # spring constant doesn't directly cause changes in weight or deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause changes in spring constant or weight
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (Spring Constant):** The spring constant is a fixed property and doesn't change as a result of the other variables. Therefore all entries in this row are 0.
* **Row 2 (Weight):** Changing the weight *directly* causes a change in the deformation of the spring. So,  `matrix[1][2] = 1`. Weight does not affect the spring constant.
* **Row 3 (Deformation):** The deformation is the *effect*.  It doesn't cause changes in the spring constant or the weight. Therefore all entries in this row are 0.

1. **Spring Constant (i=0):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It is not influenced by the weight attached or the deformation. Therefore, the spring constant doesn't cause changes in the other variables.

2. **Weight (i=1):** The weight attached to the spring directly influences how much the spring deforms. A heavier weight causes more deformation. However, the weight does *not* affect the spring constant.

3. **Deformation (i=2):**  The deformation is a result of both the weight applied and the spring constant. A higher weight leads to greater deformation, while a higher spring constant resists deformation.  Deformation doesn't cause changes in either weight or the spring's inherent constant.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* **spring_constant -> weight (0):**  No effect.  The spring's inherent stiffness doesn't change the weight.
* **spring_constant -> deformation (0):** No direct causal effect in this scenario. While the spring constant *resists* deformation, it doesn't directly *cause* it. The deformation is initiated by the weight.  It's important to note that in general, the spring constant plays a role in the resulting deformation because the deformation is determined by Hooke's Law (F = -kx). However, in this context, the causal direction is not ""spring_constant -> deformation"" because changing only the spring constant won't cause the spring to deform without external force.
* **weight -> spring_constant (0):**  No effect.  Hanging a weight doesn't change the spring's inherent property.
* **weight -> deformation (1):**  Direct effect.  Increasing the weight causes the spring to stretch more.
* **deformation -> spring_constant (0):** No effect. Stretching a spring doesn't change its inherent constant.
* **deformation -> weight (0):** No effect. The spring stretching or compressing does not alter the weight itself.


The key here is to understand the difference between causal relationships and mathematical relationships. Even if variables are connected in a formula (like Hooke's Law), it doesn't automatically mean one directly *causes* a change in the other within the context presented. The prompt focuses on what actively *causes* change. Weight initiates the change in deformation. The spring constant influences the extent of deformation but isn't the direct cause of its initiation, assuming an initial deformation of 0.","[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Spring Constant (k):** This is an inherent property of the spring itself. It represents the stiffness of the spring and is not influenced by the weight or deformation.

2. **Weight (w):** This is the force applied to the spring due to gravity acting on the mass. The weight does not depend on the spring constant or the deformation. It's an external force.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** This is the change in length of the spring from its equilibrium position.  The deformation is directly influenced by both the weight applied and the spring constant. A larger weight will cause a larger deformation, while a larger spring constant (stiffer spring) will resist deformation and result in a smaller change in length.

**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (Spring Constant):**  The spring constant doesn't cause changes in weight or deformation directly.  It's a property.
* **Row 2 (Weight):** Weight doesn't cause changes in spring constant or deformation directly.
* **Row 3 (Deformation):** The spring constant *does* affect the deformation (a higher `k` means less deformation for the same weight). The weight also affects deformation directly (higher `w` means more `x`). The deformation does not cause change in weight or spring constant.


Therefore, the deformation of the spring is the effect, and both spring constant and weight are the causes.

1. **Spring Constant (k) and Deformation (x):** A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer and will deform less under the same weight.  A lower spring constant means the spring is less stiff and will deform more under the same weight.  The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring and isn't caused by the deformation. However, the spring constant *causes* a resistance to deformation.  Thus, spring constant affects deformation.

2. **Weight (W) and Deformation (x):**  A heavier weight causes a larger deformation. A lighter weight causes a smaller deformation.  So, weight influences deformation.

3. **Deformation (x) and Spring Constant (k):**  The deformation of the spring *does not* change the spring constant. The spring constant is a fixed property of the spring itself.

4. **Deformation (x) and Weight (W):** The deformation of the spring *does not* change the weight placed on it.

5. **Weight (W) and Spring Constant (k):** The weight placed on the spring *does not* change the spring constant.

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant affects deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight affects deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation affects neither spring constant nor weight 
```

**Explanation:**

The matrix shows a unidirectional causal relationship. Both the spring constant and the weight independently cause the spring's deformation. However, the deformation itself doesn't cause a change in either the spring's constant or the weight. This reflects the physics of Hooke's Law, where `F = -kx` (force equals spring constant times deformation). In our case, the force is the weight applied. The weight and the spring constant determine the deformation, not the other way around.

2. **weight and deformation:** The weight placed on the spring directly causes it to deform. A heavier weight causes more deformation, assuming the spring constant remains the same. Therefore, `weight` causes `deformation of spring`.

3. **deformation and spring_constant/weight:** The deformation of the spring is a *result* of the spring constant and the weight applied.  The deformation itself doesn't cause the spring constant to change or the weight to change. There's no causal link in this direction.

4. **spring_constant and weight**: The spring constant is an intrinsic property of the spring and independent of the weight. Applying a weight doesn't change the spring constant. There's no causal link here.

1. **spring_constant's effect:** A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer.  A stiffer spring will deform less under the same weight. Conversely, a lower spring constant means a more flexible spring that will deform more under the same weight.  Therefore, `spring_constant` causes `deformation of spring`.

2. **weight's effect:** A heavier weight placed on the spring will cause it to deform more. A lighter weight will cause less deformation.  Therefore, `weight` causes `deformation of spring`.

3. **deformation's effect:** The deformation of the spring is a *result* of the spring constant and the weight applied. The deformation itself does not cause changes in the spring constant or the weight.  Therefore, `deformation of spring` does not cause `spring_constant` or `weight`.


**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* Row 1 (spring_constant):  `spring_constant` affects `deformation of spring` (matrix[0][2] = 1).
* Row 2 (weight): `weight` affects `deformation of spring` (matrix[1][2] = 1).
* Row 3 (deformation of spring): `deformation of spring` doesn't directly influence either `spring_constant` or `weight`.


It's important to note this represents *direct* causation.  In a more complex system, there might be indirect relationships (e.g., if the deformation becomes excessive, it might cause damage to the spring, effectively changing its spring constant. However, that would be an indirect effect, and not modeled in this direct causality matrix.

1. **spring_constant and weight → deformation:** The spring constant (stiffness) and the weight placed on the spring directly determine how much the spring deforms (compresses or stretches).  A higher spring constant means less deformation for a given weight. A heavier weight means more deformation for a given spring constant.  This is a fundamental principle of Hooke's Law.

2. **deformation → spring_constant and weight:** The deformation of the spring *does not* cause a change in the spring constant or the weight. The spring constant is a property of the spring itself, and the weight is an external force.

3. **spring_constant → weight:** The spring constant does not influence the weight applied to the spring. The weight is independent of the spring’s properties.

4. **weight → spring_constant:** The weight placed on the spring *does not* affect the spring constant. Applying weight might, over time, damage or permanently deform the spring, altering its constant, but this isn't a direct or immediate causal relationship.  We are dealing with the immediate effects of placing the weight and not long-term material fatigue.

* **Row 3 (deformation):** `[0, 0, 0]` - Deformation is the effect, not the cause.  It doesn't directly influence the spring constant or the weight.

1. **spring_constant and weight -> deformation:** The spring constant (stiffness) and the weight (force applied) together determine how much the spring deforms. A higher spring constant or a lower weight will result in less deformation, while a lower spring constant or a higher weight will result in more deformation.

2. **weight -> deformation:**  Weight directly causes deformation. Increasing the weight (applying more force) will cause more deformation.

3. **spring_constant -> deformation:**  The spring constant directly causes changes in deformation. A higher spring constant will resist deformation more, leading to less change for the same applied weight.


Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (spring_constant):**  `[0, 0, 1]` - Spring constant doesn't directly influence weight (`0`), but it does influence the spring's deformation (`1`).
* **Row 2 (weight):**  `[0, 0, 1]` - Weight doesn't influence the spring constant (`0`), but it does influence the spring's deformation (`1`).
* **Row 3 (deformation):** `[0, 0, 0]` - Deformation is the effect, not a cause. It doesn't directly influence the spring constant or the weight.


It's important to note that the spring constant is an inherent property of the spring and doesn't change in this scenario.  The weight is the external force applied, and the deformation is the resulting effect of both the weight and the spring constant.

**Thinking Step-by-Step:**

1. **Spring Constant (k):** The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring itself. It doesn't change based on the weight placed on it or the deformation.  Therefore, it doesn't get influenced by any other variables in this simplified scenario.

2. **Weight (W):**  The weight applied to the spring is an external force.  It *causes* the spring to deform. The spring constant, however, does not change as a result of the weight added to it.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** The deformation, or how much the spring compresses or stretches, is a direct *effect* of both the weight applied and the spring constant. A higher weight leads to more deformation. A higher spring constant resists deformation, so for the same weight, a higher spring constant results in less deformation.

**Causality Adjacency Matrix:**

```
[[0, 0, 0],  # spring_constant causes nothing
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [1, 1, 0]]  # spring_constant and weight cause deformation
```

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (Spring Constant):** The spring constant doesn't cause changes in weight or deformation (in this model, we consider it a fixed property). All zeros in the first row.
* **Row 2 (Weight):** Weight causes deformation (1 in the third column), but it doesn't affect the spring constant.
* **Row 3 (Deformation):** Deformation is influenced by *both* the spring constant and the weight (1s in the first and second columns), however, neither spring constant nor the weight get directly influenced by the deformation of the spring in this simplified model. In a more complex simulation (e.g., with a bouncing mass), deformation would in turn affect the force exerted on the mass and potentially further deformation and motion.


It's important to note that this is a simplified model.  In a more complete physics simulation, there could be other factors (e.g., damping, external forces) affecting deformation and potentially there could be a scenario where weight is controlled by the deformation (e.g., feedback loops) but in a simple setup of a static weight on a spring, our model is representative.

2. **Weight (W):**  This is an external force applied to the spring.  It is independent of the spring's inherent properties or how much it deforms.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** This is the change in length of the spring. It *directly* depends on both the weight applied and the spring constant. A larger weight will cause a larger deformation, while a stronger spring (higher spring constant) will resist deformation.

2. **Weight (W):** The weight is an external force applied to the spring. It's not caused by the spring constant or the deformation. In fact, it causes the spring to deform.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** The deformation, or how much the spring compresses or stretches, is a result of the interplay between the spring constant and the weight.  A higher weight will cause more deformation, while a higher spring constant will resist deformation.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],  # spring_constant doesn't cause others
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't directly cause others
```

**Explanation of Conclusions:**

* **Spring constant** is an independent variable determined by the material and construction of the spring. It influences the relationship between weight and deformation but isn't directly caused by them.

* **Weight** directly causes the **deformation** of the spring.  The relationship is governed by Hooke's Law (F = -kx), where F is the force (weight) and x is the deformation.  

* **Deformation** is the effect. While it *correlates* with both weight and spring constant, it's directly *caused* by the weight applied to a spring with a given spring constant.  The deformation doesn't cause changes in the weight or the spring constant.

1. **spring_constant (affects) deformation:** A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer and will deform less under the same weight.

2. **weight (affects) deformation:**  A heavier weight applied to the spring will cause a greater deformation. A lighter weight will cause less deformation. Therefore, weight causes changes in deformation.

3. **deformation (does not affect) spring_constant:**  The amount the spring is deformed does *not* change the inherent properties of the spring itself, so it doesn't change the spring constant.

1. **spring_constant:** The spring constant (k) is an inherent property of the spring itself.  It's determined by the material and construction of the spring and does *not* depend on the weight applied or the resulting deformation.

2. **weight:** The weight (W) of the object placed on the spring is an independent variable.  It's determined by the mass of the object and the force of gravity, and it does *not* depend on the spring constant or the spring's deformation (unless the weight is so great it permanently deforms the spring, which we're not considering here).

3. **deformation of spring:** The deformation or compression of the spring (x) is a *dependent* variable.  It's *caused* by both the weight applied to the spring *and* the spring's inherent spring constant.  A larger weight will cause greater deformation, while a larger spring constant will resist deformation and result in less compression.  This relationship is described by Hooke's Law: F = -kx, where F is the force (weight) and the negative sign indicates the force opposes the displacement.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0]]
```

**Explanation of the Matrix:**

* **Row 1 (spring_constant):**  Neither weight nor deformation affects the spring constant, so the first row is all zeros.
* **Row 2 (weight):** Similarly, neither the spring constant nor the deformation affects the weight, so the second row is all zeros.
* **Row 3 (deformation):**  Both the spring constant and the weight *do* influence the deformation of the spring. Hence, the third row has 1s in the first and second columns. The last element is 0 because deformation does not cause itself directly.


**In summary:** The spring constant and the weight are independent variables that causally influence the dependent variable, spring deformation.

A higher spring constant means a stiffer spring, and a lower spring constant means a more flexible spring. The spring constant is not caused by the weight or the deformation.

2. **Weight (W):** Weight is the force applied to the spring due to gravity acting on the mass. It's an external force independent of the spring's properties or its deformation.

3. **Deformation of the Spring (x):** The deformation (how much the spring compresses or stretches) is a *result* of the interaction between the spring constant and the weight applied.

* **Spring Constant (k)** doesn't depend on weight or deformation.
* **Weight (W)** doesn't depend on spring constant or deformation.
* **Deformation (x)** depends on *both* spring constant and weight.

* Row 1 (Spring Constant): All zeros. The spring constant is an independent variable.
* Row 2 (Weight): All zeros.  The weight is an independent variable.
* Row 3 (Deformation):  A '1' in the first and second columns indicates that both the spring constant and the weight *cause* the deformation. The '0' in the third column indicates that deformation does not cause itself.

The matrix shows that both `spring_constant` and `weight` have a direct causal effect on the `deformation` of the spring.  The deformation, however, does not directly cause a change in either the spring constant or the weight.
