Complete the causality adjacency matrix based on the identified relationships and briefly explain your conclusions.There are 3 variables: 
1. ball's volumn
2. cuboid's height
3. base area of cone
.
Please fill this causality adjacency matrix:
```
[[_, _, _],
 [_, _, _],
 [_, _, _],]
```.
In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","The provided images show a static scene with a green cuboid, a red sphere, and a blue cone.  There's no change happening over time.  Therefore, we can conclude that there are no causal relationships between the volume of the sphere, the height of the cuboid, or the base area of the cone.  They are simply placed next to each other.

The causality adjacency matrix should be all zeros:
