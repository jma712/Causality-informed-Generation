**Explanation:**

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) affects distance from image to lens (Variable 2):**  Moving the object closer to or farther from the lens *directly* changes where the image forms (its distance from the lens). This is governed by the lens equation: 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i (where f is focal length, d_o is object distance, and d_i is image distance).

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) affects Magnification (Variable 3):**  The object distance directly influences the magnification of the image.  Magnification (M) is related to the object and image distances by M = -d_i / d_o. Changing d_o directly changes M.

* **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) affects distance from object to lens (Variable 1):** Due to the lens equation, if you were to somehow *directly* manipulate the image distance (e.g., by moving a screen where the image projects), the required object distance to form a focused image would also change.

* **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) affects Magnification (Variable 3):**  The magnification also depends directly on image distance. As seen in the magnification equation, M = -d_i / d_o, altering d_i directly alters M.

* **Magnification (Variable 3) doesn't directly cause changes in object or image distance:** Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances. While we can calculate object or image distance *if we know* the magnification and one of the distances, magnification itself doesn't have a direct causal influence on the distances themselves.  You have to change the object or image distance to change the magnification, not the other way around.

**Explanation:**

1. **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) --> Distance from image to lens (Variable 2):**  Changing the object distance directly causes the image distance to change.  As the object moves closer to the lens, the image moves further away (and vice-versa), according to the lens equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v (where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance).

2. **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) --> Magnification (Variable 3):** The object distance also directly influences the magnification.  Magnification (M) is calculated as -v/u.  Therefore, changing the object distance (u) directly impacts the magnification.

3. **No other direct causal relationships:**  The image distance does *not* directly cause the object distance to change.  Moving the screen (where the image is projected) won't magically pull the object closer or further. Similarly, changing the magnification by, for example, introducing another lens, doesn't intrinsically change the object or image distances in the original lens setup.  The magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances, not a cause.

**Explanation:**

* **Row 1 (Distance from object to lens):**
    * **Column 1:** Changing the object distance doesn't directly cause a change in itself. It's the independent variable in this setup. (0)
    * **Column 2:** Changing the object distance *directly* causes a change in the image distance.  As you move the object, the image's location moves. (1)
    * **Column 3:** Changing the object distance *directly* affects the magnification.  A closer object appears larger, a further object smaller. (1)

* **Row 2 (Distance from image to lens):**
    * **Column 1:**  The image distance is a *consequence* of the object distance and the lens properties. Moving the image itself wouldn't change how far the object is from the lens. (0)
    * **Column 2:** The image's position doesn't cause itself to change in this scenario. The object's position determines the image's position. (0)
    * **Column 3:** While image distance is *related* to magnification, it's not a direct *cause*. Both are effects of the object's position. (0)

* **Row 3 (Magnification):**
    * **Column 1, 2, 3:** Magnification is the *result* of the object's position and the lens.  It cannot cause the object or image distance to change, nor can it directly affect itself. (0)


In short, the object distance is the causal driver in this simple lens system.  The image distance and magnification are consequences of the object's location relative to the lens.

**Explanation:**

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) causes distance from image to lens (Variable 2):**  Changing the object distance directly affects where the light rays converge to form an image, thus changing the image distance.  This is governed by the lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di (where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance).

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) causes Magnification (Variable 3):**  The magnification of an image formed by a convex lens is dependent on the object distance.  Magnification (M) is related to object distance (do) and image distance (di) by the formula M = -di/do.  Since changing do changes di, and both determine M, changing the object distance directly influences the magnification.

* **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) does *not* directly cause distance from object to lens (Variable 1):**  While the lens equation relates them, simply moving the screen (where the image is formed) doesn't pull the object closer or further from the lens.  The image will simply become blurry and out of focus.

* **Magnification (Variable 3) does *not* cause distance from object to lens (Variable 1) or distance from image to lens (Variable 2):** Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances, not a cause.  You cannot change the magnification directly; it changes as a consequence of altering the object's position.


In short, the object distance is the independent variable that directly influences both the image distance and the magnification.  The image distance and magnification are dependent variables in this scenario.

**Explanation:**

* **Distance from object to lens (variable 1) affects distance from image to lens (variable 2):** As the object moves closer to or further away from the convex lens, the position where the image forms (real or virtual) also changes. This can be observed in the provided animation.
* **Distance from object to lens (variable 1) affects magnification (variable 3):** Moving the object closer to the lens generally increases the magnification of the image, while moving it further away decreases it.
* **Distance from image to lens (variable 2) affects distance from object to lens (variable 1):** These two distances are linked by the lens equation (1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance). Changing one necessitates a change in the other to maintain focus.
* **Distance from image to lens (variable 2) affects magnification (variable 3):**  Magnification is also defined as the ratio of image distance to object distance (M = v/u). Thus, changing the image distance influences the magnification.
* **Magnification (variable 3) doesn't directly cause changes in object or image distance:** Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances, not a cause of them. Changing the magnification directly (e.g., by wanting a larger image) requires adjusting the object or lens position, not the other way around.


Therefore, variable 1 influences variables 2 and 3, and variable 2 influences variables 1 and 3, while variable 3 doesn't directly influence 1 or 2. This leads to the matrix shown above.

**Explanation:**

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1)  → Distance from image to lens (Variable 2):** Changing the object distance directly affects the image distance. As the object moves closer to the lens, the image moves further away (and vice versa) according to the lens equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v  where f is the focal length, u is object distance, and v is the image distance.

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) → Magnification (Variable 3):**  The object distance also directly influences the magnification.  Magnification (M) is related to object distance (u) and image distance (v) by the equation: M = -v/u. Therefore, as you change u, it directly changes the value of v (as explained above), and thus the magnification M.

* **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) does *not* directly cause Distance from object to lens (Variable 1):** While the lens equation links them, moving the *image* (in a real image scenario) is not physically possible in this setup. The image location is a *consequence* of the object's position and the lens properties.

* **Magnification (Variable 3) does not cause changes in either Variable 1 or Variable 2:** Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances; it's not a controllable variable that independently influences the others in this context. You can't change magnification directly; you change it by adjusting the object distance.

**Explanation:**

* **Object distance (variable 1) and image distance (variable 2):** These two have a reciprocal causal relationship.  Changing the object distance *causes* the image distance to change, and vice versa. This is due to the lens equation (1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is focal length, u is object distance and v is image distance).  If you fix the focal length (as in this simulation), altering 'u' *must* alter 'v', and the other way around. Therefore, matrix[0][1] = 1 and matrix[1][0] = 1.

* **Object/Image distance and Magnification (variable 3):** Both object distance and image distance influence magnification. Magnification (M) is defined as the ratio of image height to object height, and it's also related to the object and image distances by the formula M = -v/u. Therefore, changing either 'u' or 'v' *directly causes* a change in 'M'. Therefore, matrix[0][2] = 1 and matrix[1][2] = 1.

* **Magnification and Object/Image distance:** Magnification is a *consequence* of the object and image distances. It doesn't independently cause changes in them. If you were to simply change the magnification (e.g., by wanting a larger image), you'd have to physically adjust either the object or the lens itself, thus changing 'u' or 'v'. You cannot directly manipulate magnification without influencing the distances. Hence, matrix[2][0] = 0 and matrix[2][1] = 0.


It's important to distinguish between correlation and causation. While magnification is *correlated* with object and image distance, it is *caused* by them, not the other way around. The distances are the independent variables, and magnification is the dependent variable.

* **The distance of the object from the lens (1) directly influences the distance of the image from the lens (2)**.  Moving the object closer or further away forces the image to form at a different distance based on the lens equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v (where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance).

* **The distance of the object from the lens (1) directly influences the magnification (3)**.  As the object moves, the size of the image changes according to the magnification equation: M = -v/u.

* **The distance of the image from the lens (2) is a consequence, not a cause**. The image distance is dependent on the object distance and the lens properties. Changing the image distance directly wouldn't physically make sense in this setup.  You can't ""grab"" the image and move it; its position is fixed by the object's position and the lens.

* **Magnification (3) is a consequence, not a cause**. Magnification is a result of the object and image distances.  You can't ""make"" the magnification larger and thus change the object or image distances; the magnification is a description of the system's state, not an independent variable.

**Explanation:**

1. **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) → Distance from image to lens (Variable 2):** Changing the object distance directly affects the image distance.  This is governed by the lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di (where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance).  Therefore, matrix[0][1] = 1.

2. **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) → Magnification (Variable 3):** The object distance also directly influences the magnification. Magnification (M) is given by M = -di/do.  Thus, changing do directly impacts M. Therefore, matrix[0][2] = 1.

3. **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) → Distance from object to lens (Variable 1):**  While the lens equation relates these two, the causal direction is from object distance to image distance.  The image distance is a *consequence* of the object distance and the lens's properties. Changing the image distance directly *without* changing the lens or object distance is physically impossible in this setup.  So, matrix[1][0] = 0.

4. **Magnification (Variable 3) → Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) or Distance from image to lens (Variable 2):** Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances.  You can't directly change magnification without changing either the object or image distance (or the focal length, which is fixed for a given lens).  Therefore, matrix[2][0] = 0 and matrix[2][1] = 0.


In summary, the object distance is the independent variable that causally affects both the image distance and the magnification.  The image distance and magnification are dependent variables in this scenario.

**Explanation:**

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) and distance from image to lens (Variable 2):** These two variables have a reciprocal causal relationship.  Changing the object distance *directly causes* a change in the image distance, and vice versa. This is governed by the lens equation (1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance).  

* **Distance from object to lens (Variable 1) and Magnification (Variable 3):** Moving the object closer or further from the lens *directly causes* a change in magnification.  The magnification is determined by the ratio of image distance to object distance (-v/u).

* **Distance from image to lens (Variable 2) and Magnification (Variable 3):**  Similar to the above, the image distance also *directly influences* magnification.

* **Magnification (Variable 3) and Distance from object/image to lens (Variables 1 & 2):**  Magnification is a *result* of the object and image distances.  While magnification tells you about the relative sizes and orientation of the image and object, changing the magnification *itself* does not directly change the distances. You would have to physically move the object or lens to change the distances, which *then* changes the magnification.


Therefore, the object distance and image distance have a bidirectional causal relationship, while both of them independently cause a change in magnification. Magnification itself does not directly cause a change in the distances.
