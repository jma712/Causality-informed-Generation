Complete the causality adjacency matrix based on the identified relationships and briefly explain your conclusions.Example 1:
To determine the causal relationships between the spring constant, weight, and deformation of the spring, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the deformation (displacement) of the spring, given by:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer:

1. **spring_constant** (\( k \)) affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): If the spring constant increases, for the same weight, the deformation decreases.
2. **weight** affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): An increase in weight causes more deformation.
3. The **spring_constant** (\( k \)) and **weight** do not directly affect each other.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- Element (1,3) is 1 because the spring constant affects deformation.
- Element (2,3) is 1 because the weight affects deformation.
- The other entries are 0 because there is no direct causal relationship otherwise.

Example 2:
To determine the causality adjacency matrix, consider the relationship between the forces applied on either side of the seesaw and its moment or tilt. Changes in `left_force` and `right_force` can directly influence the `Seesaw Moment`, deciding which side tilts.
Here's the filled matrix:
```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- `left_force` and `right_force` affect the `Seesaw Moment` by altering the balance; hence both have a direct causal relationship to the tilt.
- The `Seesaw Moment` (tilt) does not directly cause changes in either `left_force` or `right_force`; rather it is a result of the two forces.

Example 3:
To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, we need to assess the potential causal relationships between the variables based on the images and scenario. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Ball volume** affects **water height in the cup**. The larger the ball, the higher the water level.
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** affects **water height in the cup**. A narrower bottom may cause water to rise higher.
3. **Water height in the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher water levels can increase flow length due to increased pressure.
4. **Hole height on the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher holes might result in stronger flows.

The proposed causality adjacency matrix could look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Ball volume (1) causes water height (3)**: The presence of the ball displaces water, raising its level.
- **Diameter of the bottom of the cup (2) causes water height (3)**: The shape of the cup can impact the water height due to displacement being more noticeable in narrow containers.
- **Water height (3) causes length of water flow (5)**: With more water height, there's greater pressure, which can lead to a longer water stream.
- **Hole height (4) causes length of water flow (5)**: The height of the hole affects the pressure and thus the flow's distance.

This matrix assumes no direct causations between other combinations of variables based on typical fluid mechanics.

 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],

```

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Emergence angle (2):**  The extent to which the spring is compressed directly determines the initial launch angle of the ball. Greater compression leads to a steeper angle.

2. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Height of highest point (3):** The spring's compression stores potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy and then gravitational potential energy as the ball rises.  More compression means more stored energy, leading to a higher peak.

3. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Horizontal distance (4):** The spring's compression influences both the initial velocity and launch angle of the ball. Both factors directly affect how far the ball travels horizontally.

4. **Emergence angle (2), Height of highest point (3), and Horizontal distance (4) do not cause each other or the deformation:** These variables are *effects* of the initial spring compression. They are outcomes, not causes in this system.  The emergence angle influences height and distance but is itself caused by the deformation.  Similarly, the height influences distance but is caused by the initial launch conditions (angle and speed from deformation).

Therefore, only the spring's deformation acts as a cause, influencing all other variables.  The other variables are solely effects in this specific scenario.

Example 2:
Based on the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, the incident angle determines the reflection angle.
The causality adjacency matrix for the variables """"incident_degree"""" and """"reflection_degree"""" can be represented as:

```
[[0, 1],
[0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- """"incident_degree"""" causes """"reflection_degree"""" (hence, matrix[0][1] = 1).
- There is no direct causal relationship where """"reflection_degree"""" causes """"incident_degree"""" (hence, matrix[1][0] = 0).

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring:** The deformation of the spring stores potential energy. This potential energy directly influences the initial velocity of the launched ball.  A greater deformation leads to a greater initial velocity, which in turn affects the emergence angle, the height of the highest point, and the horizontal distance traveled by the ball. Thus, deformation has a causal effect on all three other variables.

2. **Emergence angle:** The emergence angle is a consequence of the launch. It is determined by the initial velocity and direction imparted by the spring.  While the emergence angle influences the trajectory, it's a result of the deformation, not a cause of the height or horizontal distance.  Changing the emergence angle independently of the deformation wouldn't be physically realistic in this setup.

3. **Height of highest point:** The height of the highest point is determined by the initial vertical velocity component, which is a direct result of the deformation of the spring. The emergence angle also plays a role but it is itself a consequence of the deformation. Thus, the height isn't causing anything else; it is an effect of the initial launch.

4. **Horizontal distance:** Similar to the height, the horizontal distance is a consequence of both the initial velocity (determined by deformation) and the emergence angle (also determined by deformation).  The horizontal distance itself doesn't cause changes in the other variables.


Therefore, only the deformation of the spring has a direct causal influence on the other variables.  The other variables are consequences of the initial launch conditions established by the spring's deformation.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring (1) -> Height of highest point (3):** The amount the spring is compressed directly influences how high the ball will be launched. Greater compression leads to a greater height.

2. **Height of highest point (3) -> Emergence angle (2):** While the launch mechanism may set an initial launch angle, the *actual* emergence angle (the angle the ball leaves the spring after its interaction) will be influenced by the height it reaches. This is because the ball's trajectory is parabolic. If the ball achieves a greater height, the angle at the apex will be smaller, affecting the subsequent descent and thus the emergence angle.

3. **Height of highest point (3) -> Horizontal distance (4):** The height the ball reaches significantly affects how far it travels horizontally. A higher launch results in a longer flight time and, consequently, a greater horizontal distance covered.

4. **Emergence angle (2) and Horizontal distance (4) don't cause any of the other variables:**  These are outcome variables. They are affected by the prior chain of events but don't themselves directly influence the deformation of the spring or the height of the highest point.

- **Ball volume (1) causes water height (3)**: The presence of the ball displaces water, raising its level.
- **Diameter of the bottom of the cup (2) causes water height (3)**: The shape of the cup can impact the water height due to displacement being more noticeable in narrow containers.
- **Water height (3) causes length of water flow (5)**: With more water height, there's greater pressure, which can lead to a longer water stream.
- **Hole height (4) causes length of water flow (5)**: The height of the hole affects the pressure and thus the flow's distance.

**Explanation:**

The deformation of the spring (1) directly causes the initial velocity and launch angle of the balls. This initial condition then determines the trajectory of the balls. Consequently:

- **Deformation of spring (1) causes Emergence angle (2):** The more the spring is compressed, the greater the force applied to the ball, leading to a different launch angle.
- **Deformation of spring (1) causes Height of highest point (3):**  Greater spring compression results in a higher initial velocity, leading to a greater maximum height.
- **Deformation of spring (1) causes Horizontal distance (4):**  The initial velocity (influenced by spring compression) and the launch angle together determine the horizontal distance traveled.

The emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance are all *effects* of the initial conditions set by the spring's deformation.  There's no direct causal relationship between them.  For instance, while a steeper launch angle (2) might lead to a lower horizontal distance (4), this is mediated by the initial velocity, which is itself determined by the spring deformation (1).  Therefore, the remaining entries in the matrix are 0.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring:** The amount the spring is compressed directly influences how much potential energy is stored. This stored energy is then converted into kinetic energy, propelling the ball. Greater compression leads to a greater initial velocity, which affects the launch angle, maximum height, and horizontal distance traveled.

    * **Deformation of spring → Emergence angle:**  A greater compression (more deformation) will result in a higher initial velocity, affecting the launch angle.
    * **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point:**  More compression leads to a higher launch velocity, which in turn leads to a greater maximum height.
    * **Deformation of spring → Horizontal distance:** More compression results in a greater launch velocity, leading to a greater horizontal distance covered.


2. **Emergence angle:** While the emergence angle is crucial for the trajectory, it's a consequence of the initial velocity (determined by spring deformation). Once launched, the angle itself doesn't directly cause changes in height or horizontal distance. Gravity and initial velocity govern the subsequent motion.

3. **Height of highest point:** The maximum height reached is a result of the initial velocity and launch angle, both caused by the spring's deformation. The height doesn't further influence the trajectory.

4. **Horizontal distance:** Similar to the height, the horizontal distance is determined by the initial velocity and launch angle, both caused by the spring's deformation. The distance itself doesn't cause any changes in other variables.

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of Spring (1) causes Emergence Angle (2):** The extent to which the spring is compressed directly determines the initial launch velocity and therefore the angle at which the ball leaves the spring. Greater compression leads to a higher launch angle.

2. **Deformation of Spring (1) causes Height of Highest Point (3):** The spring's compression determines the initial kinetic energy imparted to the ball. This energy is converted to potential energy as the ball rises, directly influencing the maximum height achieved.

3. **Deformation of Spring (1) causes Horizontal Distance (4):** The spring's compression determines the launch velocity. A higher launch velocity (resulting from greater compression) results in the ball traveling further horizontally.

4. **Emergence Angle (2), Height of Highest Point (3), and Horizontal Distance (4) do not cause each other directly:** While these variables are related through the equations of projectile motion, they are all consequences of the initial launch conditions set by the spring's deformation. Changes in one of these derived variables wouldn't directly and independently change the others; rather, they would all be influenced by a change in the spring's deformation.

Complete the causality adjacency matrix based on the identified relationships and briefly explain your conclusions.Example 1:
To determine the causal relationships between the spring constant, weight, and deformation of the spring, we can use Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the deformation (displacement) of the spring, given by:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer:

1. **spring_constant** (\( k \)) affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): If the spring constant increases, for the same weight, the deformation decreases.
2. **weight** affects **defomation of spring** (\( x \)): An increase in weight causes more deformation.
3. The **spring_constant** (\( k \)) and **weight** do not directly affect each other.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- Element (1,3) is 1 because the spring constant affects deformation.
- Element (2,3) is 1 because the weight affects deformation.
- The other entries are 0 because there is no direct causal relationship otherwise.

Example 2:
Based on the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, the incident angle determines the reflection angle.
The causality adjacency matrix for the variables """"incident_degree"""" and """"reflection_degree"""" can be represented as:

```
[[0, 1],
[0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- """"incident_degree"""" causes """"reflection_degree"""" (hence, matrix[0][1] = 1).
- There is no direct causal relationship where """"reflection_degree"""" causes """"incident_degree"""" (hence, matrix[1][0] = 0).

Example 3:
To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, we need to assess the potential causal relationships between the variables based on the images and scenario. Here are some possible interpretations:

1. **Ball volume** affects **water height in the cup**. The larger the ball, the higher the water level.
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** affects **water height in the cup**. A narrower bottom may cause water to rise higher.
3. **Water height in the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher water levels can increase flow length due to increased pressure.
4. **Hole height on the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup**. Higher holes might result in stronger flows.

The proposed causality adjacency matrix could look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Ball volume (1) causes water height (3)**: The presence of the ball displaces water, raising its level.
- **Diameter of the bottom of the cup (2) causes water height (3)**: The shape of the cup can impact the water height due to displacement being more noticeable in narrow containers.
- **Water height (3) causes length of water flow (5)**: With more water height, there's greater pressure, which can lead to a longer water stream.
- **Hole height (4) causes length of water flow (5)**: The height of the hole affects the pressure and thus the flow's distance.

This matrix assumes no direct causations between other combinations of variables based on typical fluid mechanics.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Emergence angle (2):** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial launch angle of the ball.  Greater compression leads to a steeper angle.

2. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Height of highest point (3):**  A greater compression stores more energy in the spring, resulting in a higher launch velocity and thus a higher peak height.

3. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Horizontal distance (4):** The spring's compression influences both the launch angle and velocity, which together determine the horizontal distance traveled.

The other entries are 0 because the emergence angle, highest point, and horizontal distance are all *effects* of the initial launch conditions determined by the spring deformation. They don't directly cause each other. For example, a higher peak height doesn't cause a greater horizontal distance; they are both caused by the initial launch.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Emergence angle (2):** The amount the spring is compressed directly influences the launch angle of the ball. A greater compression leads to a steeper angle.

2. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Height of highest point (3):**  A greater compression stores more energy in the spring, resulting in a higher launch velocity and thus a greater maximum height.

3. **Deformation of spring (1) causes Horizontal distance (4):** The deformation affects both the launch angle and initial velocity, both of which contribute to the horizontal distance traveled.  Greater compression will generally lead to a greater horizontal distance (though there's an optimal angle for maximum distance).

4. **Emergence angle (2), Height of highest point (3), and Horizontal distance (4) do not directly cause each other or the deformation.** These are effects of the initial spring compression. They are correlated, but one doesn't directly *cause* the other.  For example, while a higher launch angle affects the height and distance, the angle itself is determined by the spring deformation.  The height and distance are outcomes of the launch conditions, not direct causes of each other.
