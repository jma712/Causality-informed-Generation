**Explanation:**

* **Deformation of spring (Var 1) -> Emergence angle (Var 2):** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial launch angle of the ball.  A greater compression leads to a steeper angle.

* **Deformation of spring (Var 1) -> Height of highest point (Var 3):** The spring's compression stores potential energy, which is converted to kinetic energy and then gravitational potential energy as the ball rises.  Greater compression results in a higher launch velocity and therefore a greater maximum height.

* **Height of highest point (Var 3) -> Horizontal distance (Var 4):**  For a given launch angle, a greater height achieved means the ball spends more time in the air, allowing it to travel further horizontally.


* **Why other relationships are 0:**
    * **Emergence angle doesn't directly cause height or distance.** While angle influences both, it's the combination of angle *and* initial velocity (determined by spring compression) that defines the trajectory.
    * **Horizontal distance doesn't cause any other variables.** It's the ""effect"" in this causal chain.
    *  There's no feedback in this system. The outcome of the ball's flight doesn't influence the spring's compression or the subsequent launch.


The provided images show a classic projectile motion scenario where the initial conditions (spring compression) determine the trajectory.  The causal chain flows from initial energy storage to launch conditions to flight characteristics.

**Explanation:**

2. **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point:**  The spring's compression stores potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy and then gravitational potential energy as the ball rises.  A greater compression results in a higher launch velocity and thus a greater maximum height.

3. **Emergence angle → Horizontal distance:** The angle at which the ball is launched directly influences how far it travels horizontally.  A shallower angle will lead to a longer horizontal distance, while a steeper angle will lead to a shorter horizontal distance.

4. **Height of highest point → Horizontal distance:** The maximum height reached by the ball affects the time it spends in the air. A higher peak gives the ball more time to travel horizontally, therefore influencing the horizontal distance covered.


It's important to note that while there's a correlation between deformation and horizontal distance, and it might seem like a direct causal link, the angle acts as a mediating variable.  The deformation affects the angle, and the angle affects the distance. Therefore, there is no direct causal effect between them. Similar reasoning applies to the link between Emergence angle and horizontal distance, the height reached mediates this and needs to be taken into account.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring → Emergence angle:** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the launch angle of the ball. A greater compression leads to a steeper launch angle.

2. **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point:** The spring's compression stores potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy and then gravitational potential energy as the ball rises.  More compression means more stored energy, thus a higher maximum height.

3. **Emergence angle → Horizontal distance:**  For a given initial velocity (influenced by spring compression), the launch angle determines how that velocity is split between vertical and horizontal components.  A steeper angle leads to less horizontal distance traveled.

4. **Height of highest point → Horizontal distance:** The maximum height achieved indirectly influences the horizontal distance.  A higher apex implies a longer flight time, contributing to greater horizontal distance. This is, however, a consequence of the initial velocity and launch angle and not a direct causal relation in the same way the other connections are.  Given emergence angle and spring deformation, the height contributes nothing extra to determine the distance, therefore there is no direct causal link.

**Why other entries are zero:**

* **Horizontal distance** cannot influence any other variable. The effects proceed outward from the spring.
* **Emergence angle** is determined solely by spring deformation in this simplified setup.
* **Height of highest point** is a consequence of the initial conditions set by the spring's deformation and the resulting emergence angle. It doesn't directly cause changes in the other variables. It's an intermediate step in the causal chain.


It's important to note that this analysis assumes ideal conditions (no air resistance, perfect elasticity, etc.). In a real-world scenario, other factors could introduce additional causal relationships.

4. **Height of highest point → Horizontal distance:**  The maximum height the ball reaches is directly related to the time it spends in the air. A higher apex means more time aloft, contributing to a greater horizontal distance covered.

**Why other relationships are 0:**

* **Horizontal distance cannot cause any other variable.**  The distance the ball travels is a *result* of the initial launch conditions, not a cause.
* **Emergence angle and height are causally linked through the deformation of spring.** Changing one changes the other, but one doesn't *directly* cause the other. Instead their mutual relationship is explained by the underlying variable (spring deformation).

2. **Deformation of spring -> Height of highest point:** A greater compression imparts more initial kinetic energy, leading to a higher trajectory and a higher maximum height.

3. **Emergence angle -> Horizontal distance:** The angle at which the ball is launched directly affects how far it travels horizontally.  A steeper angle will result in a shorter horizontal distance, while a shallower angle will result in a longer horizontal distance.

4. **Height of highest point -> Horizontal distance:**  A higher peak height implies a longer flight time, which in turn contributes to a greater horizontal distance traveled.  While both emergence angle and highest point influence horizontal distance, the highest point is influenced *by* the initial velocity (via the spring deformation), so the emergence angle is the more direct cause.

The other matrix entries are zero because there are no other direct causal relationships. For instance, the horizontal distance doesn't cause any changes to the launch angle, the spring deformation, or the peak height.  These are determined prior to the ball's flight.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring (DS) → Emergence angle (EA):** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial angle at which the ball is launched.  Greater compression leads to a steeper launch angle.

2. **Deformation of spring (DS) → Height of highest point (HHP):**  A greater compression of the spring imparts more initial velocity to the ball. This higher initial velocity directly translates to a greater height reached by the ball.

3. **Emergence angle (EA) → Horizontal distance (HD):**  The launch angle is a primary determinant of how far the ball travels horizontally.  A flatter angle will lead to greater horizontal distance, while a steeper angle will prioritize vertical height.

4. **Height of highest point (HHP) → Horizontal distance (HD):**  While the emergence angle is the primary driver, the height of the highest point also influences the horizontal distance. A higher apex allows for more time spent airborne, contributing to a greater horizontal distance covered.

**Why other relationships are 0:**

* **No variable directly causes spring deformation:**  In this scenario, the deformation of the spring is the initial condition, assumed to be set externally.
* **Emergence angle doesn't influence height:**  The height reached is primarily determined by the initial velocity, which is directly related to spring deformation, not the emergence angle. While the angle contributes to the *vertical* component of the velocity, it's the *overall* velocity magnitude that determines the height.
* **Horizontal distance doesn't cause any other variable:** The horizontal distance travelled is an outcome, influenced by previous factors but not influencing them.

4. **Height of highest point (variable 3) does not directly cause any other variable:** While the height is related to the initial velocity, it's a consequence of the spring's compression, not a cause of other variables.  The height is an intermediate effect, not a direct cause of the horizontal distance. The horizontal distance is directly influenced by the launch angle and initial velocity.

5. **Horizontal distance (variable 4) does not directly cause any other variable:** The horizontal distance traveled is an outcome of the initial launch conditions and does not influence the spring, launch angle, or height of the trajectory.


Therefore, the completed matrix reflects these direct causal relationships.  It's important to note this represents a simplified model, ignoring factors like air resistance.

[[0, 1, 1, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0],

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring → Emergence angle (1):** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial velocity and launch angle of the ball.  A greater compression leads to a higher launch speed and thus, affects the emergence angle.

2. **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point (1):**  The spring's compression directly influences the initial kinetic energy imparted to the ball. More compression means more kinetic energy, which translates to a higher maximum height reached by the ball.

3. **Deformation of spring → Horizontal distance (0):** While the spring's compression affects the initial velocity, it doesn't *directly* determine the horizontal distance. The horizontal distance is a consequence of both the initial velocity *and* the launch angle. Therefore, there's no direct causal link but rather, is mediated by emergence angle.

4. **Emergence angle → Horizontal distance (1):**  For a given launch speed, the emergence angle directly determines the horizontal distance traveled.  A steeper angle will result in a shorter horizontal distance, while a shallower angle will result in a longer horizontal distance.

5. **Height of highest point → Horizontal distance (0):** The maximum height and horizontal distance are both effects of the initial conditions (spring compression and launch angle).  There's no direct causal link between them. They are correlated because they share a common cause, not because one causes the other.


The remaining entries in the matrix are 0 because there's no plausible mechanism by which the other variables would directly influence each other.  The height and horizontal distance are dependent variables, solely influenced by the initial conditions set by the spring and launch angle. They don't cause changes in the spring's compression or the emergence angle.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring → Emergence angle:** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial launch velocity and angle of the ball.  A greater compression results in a higher launch angle.

2. **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point:** The spring's compression provides the initial kinetic energy, which is converted to potential energy as the ball rises. Greater compression leads to more kinetic energy and thus a higher peak height.

3. **Emergence angle → Horizontal distance:**  The angle at which the ball is launched directly affects how far it travels horizontally. A steeper angle leads to a shorter horizontal distance, while a shallower angle leads to a longer horizontal distance.

4. **Height of highest point does not directly cause horizontal distance** Although correlated, the height itself doesn't cause the horizontal distance. Both are effects of the initial conditions provided by the spring.

5. **Horizontal distance does not cause any other variable.**  It is a dependent variable determined by the launch conditions.


In summary: The spring's deformation is the root cause, influencing both the emergence angle and the height of the highest point. The emergence angle then influences the horizontal distance.

**Explanation:**

1. **Deformation of spring → Emergence angle (1):** The amount the spring is compressed directly determines the initial velocity and launch angle of the ball.  Greater compression leads to a higher launch angle.

2. **Deformation of spring → Height of highest point (1):**  The spring's compression provides the initial kinetic energy, which is converted to potential energy as the ball rises.  More compression results in a greater height.

3. **Emergence angle → Horizontal distance (1):** For a given initial velocity (determined by the spring compression), the launch angle determines how that velocity is split between horizontal and vertical components. This directly affects the horizontal distance traveled.

4. **Height of highest point → Horizontal distance (1):** The height the ball reaches influences the time it spends in the air.  A higher peak means more flight time, thus increasing the horizontal distance covered.  (While the angle and initial speed jointly determine the height and therefore the horizontal distance, assuming those other things are equal, higher peaks mean greater distance)

5. **No other direct causal links (0):**  The other entries in the matrix are zero because there are no other direct causal relationships. For instance, the horizontal distance doesn't cause any change in the spring, the angle, or the peak height. Similarly, the emergence angle and the height both are a consequence of the initial launch conditions (spring deformation) and influence the horizontal distance, but not each other directly.
