They are placed in the scene independently.  There's no physics engine or constraints linking them.  If you were to shrink the ball, the cuboid wouldn't change size or position as a result.  They are simply coexisting in the same scene.

**Explanation:**

The animation shows the cuboid's height changing and the cone sometimes getting taller, sometimes getting shorter and wider.  The ball's volume stays constant.  However, these changes appear to be pre-programmed animations and do not reflect any *causal* relationship between the variables.  Changing the height of the cuboid does not *cause* the cone's dimensions to change, and vice-versa.  A programmer decided on those animations independently.  Therefore, all entries in the causality adjacency matrix are 0. There are no direct causal relationships between the shape properties demonstrated in the animation.

```

**Explanation:**

None of the variables directly influence each other in the provided video. The objects' sizes and shapes are predetermined and manipulated independently.  Changing the volume of the ball doesn't cause the cuboid's height or base area to change, and vice versa. The same applies to the cone's base area. They are separate, independent attributes.  The animation just scales the cone, and nothing else. There's no implicit or explicit causal link shown between these properties.

Similarly, alterations in the cone's base area have no effect on the cuboid or the sphere.  There's no depicted causal link between any of these variables.

**Explanation:**

The provided video shows static geometric shapes. There's no change in any of the variables (volume, height, base areas) over time.  Therefore, there are no causal relationships to be observed.  The properties of the shapes are fixed and independent of each other. Changes in one variable do *not* cause changes in any other variable within this specific scenario.

**Explanation:**

Throughout the provided video, the volume of the ball, the height of the cuboid, the base area of the cuboid, and the base area of the cone remain constant.  There are no changes in any of these variables, which means there cannot be any demonstrable causal relationship between them within the context of this video.  A causal relationship implies that a change in one variable *causes* a change in another.  Since no variable changes, we cannot observe any causal effects. Therefore, all entries in the causality adjacency matrix are 0.

Changing the volume of the sphere, for instance, doesn't force the cuboid to become taller or change its base.  Similarly, altering the dimensions of the cuboid has no impact on the sphere or the cone.  They exist in the scene together but without causal links.

**Explanation:**

The video shows a static scene with a green cuboid, a red sphere, and a blue cone.  The properties of these shapes (volume, height, base area) are independent of each other.  Changing one property doesn't *cause* a change in any other property.  They are simply placed next to each other. There's no causal relationship between the attributes of the different objects.  A larger sphere does not cause the cuboid to be taller or the cone's base to be wider. All these attributes are predefined and static in the provided video.
