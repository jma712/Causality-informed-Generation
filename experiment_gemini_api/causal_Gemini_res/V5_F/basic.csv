**Explanation:**

The animation shows the objects changing in size, sometimes becoming smaller and sometimes larger.  However, there's no indication that the change in one object's dimensions *causes* the change in another's.  They are all changing independently.  The variables are correlated in the sense that they change together in the animation, but correlation does not imply causation.

**Explanation:**

The animation shows the objects scaling up and down simultaneously.  While they change size together in the animation, there's no inherent *causal* relationship between the dimensions of any of these objects.  The scaling is externally driven (presumably by the animation software).  Changing the ball's volume doesn't *cause* the cuboid's height to change; they are both being changed by an unseen animation control.  Therefore, all entries in the causality adjacency matrix should be 0.
