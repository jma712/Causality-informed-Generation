1. **Deformation of spring** affects the initial energy given to the object. This causes changes in the **emergence angle**, **height of highest point**, and **horizontal distance**.

2. **Emergence angle** influences both the **height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** traveled. A steeper angle generally leads to a higher peak but shorter distance, while a shallower angle results in lower height and longer distance.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This directly influences the initial energy of the system. Therefore, it affects:
   - The emergence angle (as the force applied can influence the angle at which the object is launched).
   - The height of the highest point (since more deformation means more potential energy converted to kinetic energy, affecting height).
   - The horizontal distance (since the kinetic energy affects the range).

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the trajectory, which influences:
   - The height of the highest point.
   - The horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This purely depends on the energy and angle, so it does not directly cause any of the other factors.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This results from the energy and angle, so it does not cause the other factors.

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],

### Explanation:

- The **deformation of spring** affects all other variables because it is the initial condition influencing energy, angle, height, and distance.
- The **emergence angle** affects both the height and distance since it changes how the energy is distributed in vertical versus horizontal components.
- The **height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance** are outcomes rather than causal factors in this system.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This is the initial condition that influences the energy imparted to the projectile.
2. **Emergence Angle**: This determines both vertical and horizontal components of velocity.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: Affected by the projectile's initial velocity (determined by spring deformation) and angle.
4. **Horizontal Distance**: Depends on the horizontal component of velocity and initial speed.

Based on the principles of mechanics:

- **Deformation of Spring** directly affects the **Emergence Angle** due to the initial velocity vector direction (thus affecting the trajectory), the **Height of the Highest Point**, and the **Horizontal Distance** (since it determines initial energy).

- **Emergence Angle** affects both the **Height of the Highest Point** and the **Horizontal Distance** due to its influence on the projectile path.

- **Height of the Highest Point** is an outcome, influenced by the initial conditions but not a direct causal factor for others.

- **Horizontal Distance** is similarly an outcome determined by influencing factors.

   - Horizontal distance (more energy enables the projectile to travel further)

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the object leaves the spring affects the trajectory of the projectile.

3. **Height of highest point**: The maximum height achieved by the projectile depends on the vertical component of the initial velocity, which is affected by the deformation and angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**: The total horizontal distance traveled depends on both the horizontal component of the initial velocity and the time of flight, which is influenced by the angle and initial speed.

2. **Emergence angle:** This angle influences the projectile's trajectory, affecting both the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This is the primary input; a compressed spring releases energy. More deformation implies more stored energy, leading to greater launch speed.

2. **Emergence Angle**: Affects the trajectory of the projectile and influences both the maximum height and horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: Determined by the speed (energy from spring deformation) and angle. 

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Affected by initial velocity (from spring deformation) and launch angle.

Based on these considerations, the relationships can be visualized as:

- Deformation of Spring affects Emergence Angle (if the spring deformation setup includes an angular mechanism).
- Deformation of Spring affects Height of Highest Point.
- Deformation of Spring affects Horizontal Distance.
- Emergence Angle affects Height of Highest Point.
- Emergence Angle affects Horizontal Distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. The emergence angle determines the trajectory and proportions of vertical and horizontal components of the motion.

3. **Height of highest point**: Typically, this does not directly affect other variables unless there’s feedback to adjust the angle or spring deformation.

4. **Horizontal distance**: Similarly, this is more a result of conditions rather than a cause.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This variable likely affects all other variables, as the potential energy stored in the spring upon deformation determines how far and high the object will go, and possibly the angle depending on how the energy is released.
2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the trajectory path, influencing both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.
3. **Height of highest point**: This variable is influenced by both the deformation of the spring (more energy can mean a higher trajectory) and the emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: This is influenced by the spring deformation (determining the launch energy) and the emergence angle (affecting the path).

Based on the above reasoning, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],  # Deformation of spring affects emergence angle, height of highest point, and horizontal distance
 [0, 0, 1, 1],  # Emergence angle affects height of highest point and horizontal distance
 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Height of highest point is an outcome and doesn't directly affect other variables
 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Horizontal distance is an outcome and doesn't directly affect other variables
