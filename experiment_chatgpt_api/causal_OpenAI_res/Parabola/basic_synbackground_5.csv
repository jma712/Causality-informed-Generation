3. **Height of highest point (3)**: This is influenced by both the initial velocity (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle. A greater initial velocity or a more vertical angle generally results in a higher apex.

4. **Horizontal distance (4)**: This is affected by initial velocity, the emergence angle, and gravity. A combination of optimal initial velocity and angle optimizes the horizontal distance.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This is the initial potential energy that gets converted to kinetic energy when released. It's likely the primary cause affecting the emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**: Affects how energy is split between vertical and horizontal components, influencing both height of the highest point and horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is influenced primarily by the energy provided by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Also influenced by the deformation of the spring and emergence angle, but not directly by height.

2. **Emergence Angle**: This affects the trajectory, determining the height and the horizontal distance of the projectile.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is influenced by both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, but it doesn't directly affect the other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is influenced by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, but it also doesn't directly affect the other variables.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This typically affects the launch energy of a projectile. The greater the deformation, the more potential energy is stored and thus converted into kinetic energy on release. This directly affects the horizontal distance and the height of the highest point (via kinetic energy). It may indirectly influence the angle if the deformation affects how the spring system releases the projectile, but this is more specific to the mechanical setup.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which a projectile is launched will directly impact both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance covered. Typically, the optimal angle for maximizing distance is 45 degrees, and angles closer to vertical will increase height.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is primarily influenced by the launch velocity (which originates from the spring deformation) and the emergence angle. It doesn't directly cause other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is a result of the initial velocity (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle. Like height, it doesn't cause other variables.

Based on these causal relationships, the adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],  # Deformation of spring influences angle, height, and distance
 [0, 0, 1, 1],  # Emergence angle influences height and distance
 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Height doesn't directly influence other variables
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Distance doesn't directly influence other variables
```

Explanation:
- Deformation of the spring causes changes in emergence angle, height, and distance due to its effect on launch velocity and mechanics.
- Emergence angle impacts the height and distance through its trigonometric influence on projectile motion.
- Height and distance are results of the initial conditions and do not cause changes in other variables directly.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"
