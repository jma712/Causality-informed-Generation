1. **Deformation of spring** influences:
   - The force with which the object is launched affects both the **height** of the highest point and the **horizontal distance**. Therefore, it impacts these two variables.

2. **Emergence angle** influences:
   - The angle at which the object is launched affects both the **height** and the **horizontal distance**, as it defines the trajectory.

   - This variable is influenced by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, but it does not directly influence any other variable.

   - Like the height, this is influenced by the spring deformation and emergence angle but does not cause changes in other variables directly.
