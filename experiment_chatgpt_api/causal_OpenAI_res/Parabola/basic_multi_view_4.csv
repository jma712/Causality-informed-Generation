1. **Deformation of spring**: How much the spring is compressed.
2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the ball is launched.
3. **Height of highest point**: The peak height the ball reaches.
4. **Horizontal distance**: The distance the ball travels horizontally.

### Causal Relationships:

- **Deformation of spring** affects:
  - **Height of highest point**: More deformation means more energy, leading to a higher peak.
  - **Horizontal distance**: More deformation means the ball can travel further horizontally.

- **Emergence angle** affects:
  - **Height of highest point**: A steeper angle will result in a higher peak.
  - **Horizontal distance**: The launch angle influences how far the ball travels.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This affects the initial potential energy stored in the spring, which in turn impacts the launch speed and possibly the angle of a projectile.
2. **Emergence Angle**: This affects the trajectory shape, influencing both the height and distance a projectile will travel.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: This directly depends on both the initial speed (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal Distance**: This depends on both the initial speed (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

Given these relationships:

- **Deformation of Spring** causes both the **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** by providing the kinetic energy necessary for motion.
  
- **Deformation of Spring** may influence the **Emergence Angle**, depending on the mechanism of release, but this isnâ€™t clear without additional mechanical details.

- **Emergence Angle** causes the **Height of Highest Point** and the **Horizontal Distance** by determining the motion path.

2. **Emergence angle:** The angle at which the object emerges will likely influence the horizontal distance and the height of the highest point, due to projectile motion mechanics.

3. **Height of highest point:** This variable is primarily affected by the initial kinetic energy from the spring (which comes from deformation) and the emergence angle, but does not directly influence the other variables.

4. **Horizontal distance:** This is also primarily affected by the initial kinetic energy from the spring and the emergence angle, but does not directly influence the other variables.

1. **Deformation of Spring â†’ Emergence Angle**: Typically, the deformation of a spring does not directly affect the angle of emergence unless under specific constraints, so generally, this would be 0.

2. **Deformation of Spring â†’ Height of Highest Point**: More significant deformation of the spring results in more potential energy being transferred to kinetic energy, impacting both vertical and horizontal components. Thus, this is likely 1.

3. **Deformation of Spring â†’ Horizontal Distance**: Greater deformation would directly affect how far the projectile travels, so this is 1.

4. **Emergence Angle â†’ Height of Highest Point**: The angle affects the vertical component of the velocity, influencing the height, so this is 1.

5. **Emergence Angle â†’ Horizontal Distance**: The angle affects how far the projectile will travel on a plane, influencing horizontal distance, so this is 1.

6. **Height of Highest Point â†’ Horizontal Distance**: There is no direct causal relationship because the horizontal distance is more about initial velocity and angle, not just height. This would be 0.

1. Deformation of spring
2. Emergence angle
3. Height of highest point
4. Horizontal distance

### Causal Analysis:

1. **Deformation of Spring:**
   - More deformation increases the potential energy in the system. This increased energy affects both the height of the apex and the horizontal distance the object travels.

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - This angle determines the trajectory, which influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - This is affected by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle but does not directly cause changes in other variables.
   
4. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - Influenced by both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle. It also doesnâ€™t directly influence other variables.

### Explanation:

- **Deformation of Spring** causes changes in:

  - **Horizontal Distance** (more energy means a longer travel distance).

- **Emergence Angle** causes changes in:
  - **Height of Highest Point** (determines trajectory height).
  - **Horizontal Distance** (influences travel path).

1. **Deformation of spring**: The deformation (compression or extension) of the spring directly affects the launch velocity of the object. This, in turn, influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance traveled.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the object is launched affects how much of the velocity contributes to vertical and horizontal motion, impacting both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is influenced by both the spring deformation (through initial velocity) and the emergence angle. It does not directly affect the deformation of the spring or the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is influenced by both the initial velocity (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle. It does not directly affect the deformation of the spring or the emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of spring** is likely to cause changes in both the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance**, as more deformation typically means more stored energy on release, affecting how far and how high the object travels.

2. **Emergence angle** affects the **horizontal distance** and the **height of the highest point**. The angle of release determines the trajectory, influencing both height and distance.

3. **Height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** are results rather than causes, so they are not likely to directly affect the deformation of the spring or the emergence angle.

- **Deformation of spring â†’ Height of highest point** (1)
- **Deformation of spring â†’ Horizontal distance** (1)

3. **Height of highest point**: This is a result of the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, so it doesnâ€™t directly cause the deformation or the emergence angle.
