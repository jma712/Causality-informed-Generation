1. **Deformation of spring**:
   - This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance because the more the spring is compressed, the more potential energy is stored and converted into kinetic energy upon release.

2. **Emergence angle**:
   - This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. A higher angle typically results in a higher trajectory but might reduce horizontal distance compared to an optimal angle (usually 45 degrees).

3. **Height of highest point**:
   - This does not directly cause changes in other variables but is a result of spring deformation and emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**:
   - This is similarly a result of the spring deformation and emergence angle, rather than a cause.

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],

- Deformation of spring causes the height of the highest point and horizontal distance (first row).
- Emergence angle also affects the height of the highest point and horizontal distance (second row).
- The height of the highest point and horizontal distance results from other variables, hence they have zeros in the respective rows.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

2. **Emergence Angle**: This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance directly through the equations of motion for projectiles.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: Primarily depends on the initial velocity and emergence angle. It doesn't directly affect the other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Depends on the initial velocity and emergence angle, which are determined by the spring deformation and angle of release.

With these relationships in mind, here's the causal adjacency matrix:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],

### Explanation

- **Deformation of Spring to Emergence Angle (1)**: The deformation directly affects the force with which the spring pushes out, which can influence the emergence angle in some setups, so this is indirect but relevant in controlled conditions.
  
- **Deformation of Spring to Height of Highest Point (1)**: More deformation results in a greater force applied, increasing the potential height.

- **Deformation of Spring to Horizontal Distance (1)**: Greater deformation results in a greater initial velocity, thus potentially increasing the horizontal range.

- **Emergence Angle to Height of Highest Point (1)**: The angle directly affects the trajectory and peak height.

- **Emergence Angle to Horizontal Distance (1)**: The angle of release affects the trajectory, which in turn affects how far the object travels horizontally.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of Spring**: When a spring is compressed or stretched, it stores potential energy that can be converted into kinetic energy upon release. This affects:
   - The initial speed of the projectile.
   - The emergence angle, if the spring is part of a launcher that determines direction.
   - The height the object can reach due to energy conversion.
   - The horizontal distance traveled based on initial speed and angle.

2. **Emergence Angle**: Affects:
   - The height the object can reach.
   - The horizontal distance traveled, as these are influenced by projection angle according to projectile motion principles.
  
3. **Height of Highest Point**: Primarily a result of initial speed and emergence angle, rather than a cause of other factors.

Based on these relationships:

- The deformation of the spring directly affects the emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance.
- The emergence angle directly affects the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
