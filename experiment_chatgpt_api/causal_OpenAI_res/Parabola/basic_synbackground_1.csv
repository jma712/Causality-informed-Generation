1. **Deformation of Spring (1)**: This is the initial cause of motion; it affects the force exerted and thus impacts both the height and the distance traveled by the object, as well as potentially influencing the emergence angle.

2. **Emergence Angle (2)**: This angle, once set, affects the trajectory shape, influencing both the height of the highest point (3) and the horizontal distance (4) but is not directly affected by them.

1. **Deformation of spring** directly affects:
   - Emergence angle (angle can change based on how the spring is compressed)
   - Height of highest point (more compression generally means more potential energy, translating to greater height)
   - Horizontal distance (greater compression usually results in greater horizontal distance)

2. **Emergence angle** directly affects:
   - Height of highest point (larger angles can result in higher points, depending on the launch velocity)
   - Horizontal distance (the angle determines how much of the velocity is directed horizontally)

3. **Height of highest point** is affected by:
   - Deformation of spring
   - Emergence angle

4. **Horizontal distance** is affected by:
   - Deformation of spring
   - Emergence angle

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- The deformation of the spring causes changes in the emergence angle, height, and horizontal distance.
- The emergence angle affects both height and horizontal distance.

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To create the causality adjacency matrix for the variables, let's analyze each potential causal relationship:

1. **Deformation of spring** influences both the initial kinetic energy and the force applied to the object. Thus, it affects both the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** traveled.

2. **Emergence angle** affects the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** based on projectile motion principles.

3. **Height of highest point** is determined by the initial kinetic energy and the angle but does not directly influence the emergence angle or the horizontal distance.

4. **Horizontal distance** is determined by the initial kinetic energy, angle, and does not directly influence other variables once the motion has started.

 [0, 0, 1, 1],

1. **Deformation of spring** affects the initial **velocity** (energy transfer), which impacts both the **height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance**.
2. **Emergence angle** affects both the **height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance**.
