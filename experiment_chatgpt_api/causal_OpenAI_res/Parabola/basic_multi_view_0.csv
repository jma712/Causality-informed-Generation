1. **Deformation of Spring**:
   - Causes a change in the **emergence angle** because how much the spring is compressed can affect the direction of the force applied on release.
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** because more deformation generally means more potential energy, leading to a higher maximum height on release.
   - Influences the **horizontal distance** traveled because the energy and angle at release can affect the range.

2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** since certain angles will lead to higher vertical displacement.
   - Influences the **horizontal distance** because angles closer to 45 degrees (in the absence of air resistance) will generally maximize range.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - Not directly causing deformation of the spring, emergence angle, or horizontal distance, but it is an outcome of the initial conditions.

4. **Horizontal Distance**:
   - Primarily an outcome influenced by deformation, emergence angle but does not directly cause changes in the other variables.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This represents how much the spring is compressed or extended. It directly affects the following:
   - **Emergence angle**: Depending on how the spring is designed, different deformations might change the angle at which the object is launched.
   - **Height of highest point**: More deformation generally means more potential energy, which results in a higher launch.
   - **Horizontal distance**: Greater deformation typically allows for greater potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, affecting the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects:
   - **Height of highest point**: A steeper angle generally results in a higher maximum point.
   - **Horizontal distance**: A shallower angle can increase horizontal distance if other factors (like energy) remain constant.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is primarily a result rather than a cause.
4. **Horizontal distance**: Similarly, this is mostly a result of the initial conditions rather than a cause of them.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This typically refers to the compression or elongation of the spring. A more compressed spring means more potential energy and, consequently, impacts the launch velocity.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which an object leaves the spring. This affects both the height and horizontal distance of the projectile.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: The maximum vertical position reached by the object. This is influenced by the initial velocity and emergence angle.

- **Deformation of Spring** impacts:
  - **Emergence Angle**: Not directly caused. The emergence angle can be adjusted independently. (**0**)
  - **Height of Highest Point**: Increased deformation (compression) increases potential energy, impacting height. (**1**)
  - **Horizontal Distance**: Similarly, increased potential energy affects horizontal distance. (**1**)

- **Emergence Angle** impacts:
  - **Deformation of Spring**: No direct effect. (**0**)
  - **Height of Highest Point**: Affects projectile height due to changes in initial vertical velocity. (**1**)
  - **Horizontal Distance**: Affects range based on the projectile motion equations. (**1**)

- **Deformation of Spring**:
  - Can affect the **Emergence Angle** (1), since a higher energy shot may alter optimal angles.
  - Can affect the **Height of Highest Point** (1), since greater deformation implies more energy transferred, potentially increasing height.
  - Can affect the **Horizontal Distance** (1), as more energy allows for greater distance.

- **Emergence Angle**:
  - Can affect the **Height of Highest Point** (1), since the angle determines the vertical component of the velocity.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This is the initial condition that stores potential energy, which gets converted to kinetic energy when released.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which the object leaves the spring, affecting the trajectory of the object.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is influenced by both the initial energy (from deformation) and angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is affected by the same factors as height but focuses on horizontal motion.

Based on these dynamics, let's determine the causal relationships:

- Deformation of the spring directly affects the emergence angle, height, and horizontal distance.
- Emergence angle directly affects the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
- Height of the highest point does not directly affect the other variables.
- Horizontal distance does not directly affect the other variables.

Given this analysis, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],

 [0, 0, 0, 0]]

- `matrix[0][2] = 1`: Deformation causes height.
- `matrix[0][3] = 1`: Deformation causes horizontal distance.

1. **Deformation of Spring:** This variable affects both the emergence angle and the initial velocity of the object being launched. From the initial velocity, both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance can be derived.

2. **Emergence Angle:** This angle influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile.

3. **Height of Highest Point:** This is a result of the initial velocity (from spring deformation) and the emergence angle, not a cause for other variables directly in this context.

4. **Horizontal Distance:** Similarly, this depends on the initial velocity and emergence angle but does not directly cause changes in other variables in this context.

 [0, 0, 1, 1],

1. **Deformation of Spring:** The initial compression or deformation of the spring will affect the energy transferred to the object, influencing speed, and subsequently, the height and distance.
   
2. **Emergence Angle:** The angle at which the object is launched affects both the height of the apex and the horizontal distance traveled.
   
3. **Height of Highest Point:** Depends on the speed and the angle of launch, which are directly related to spring deformation and emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance:** Also depends on the speed and the angle, directly influenced by the deformation and angle.

### Explanation

  - Causes **emergence angle (2nd variable)**: The degree of deformation affects the angle at which the object emerges.
  - Causes **height of highest point (3rd variable)**: More deformation means more energy, resulting in a higher trajectory.
  - Causes **horizontal distance (4th variable)**: More initial force from deformation leads to a longer distance.

- **Emergence angle (2nd variable)**
  - Causes **height of highest point (3rd variable)**: A steeper angle increases the maximum height.
  - Causes **horizontal distance (4th variable)**: Affects the range of the projectile.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This variable typically affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance since a more deformed spring would exert more force on the object, affecting its trajectory.

2. **Emergence Angle**: This influences both the height and the horizontal distance. A higher angle generally results in a higher maximum point but might reduce horizontal distance, while a lower angle increases the distance but reduces height.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is a result of the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, but it doesn't directly affect other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Like the height, this results from the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

   - Affects the **emergence angle** and the **initial velocity** (not listed but implied in vertical and horizontal motion).
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** due to initial vertical velocity.
   - Affects the **horizontal distance**, as more deformation leads to more horizontal velocity.

2. **Emergence angle**:
   - Influences the **height of the highest point**. Higher angles result in higher peaks but not necessarily more horizontal distance if angle is too steep.
   - Affects the **horizontal distance**, in combination with velocity, as it determines the projectile's trajectory.

3. **Height of highest point**:
   - Typically a result of the previous inputs, does not directly influence other variables.
