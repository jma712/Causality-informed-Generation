1. **Deformation of spring** causes:
   - **Height of highest point**: The more the spring deforms, the greater the potential energy stored, leading to a higher launching point.
   - **Horizontal distance**: More deformation results in greater energy, affecting both height and horizontal distance traveled.
   - **Emergence angle**: Depending on how the spring deformation is applied, it can influence the launch angle.

2. **Emergence angle** causes:
   - **Height of highest point**: A steeper angle can increase the height reached.
   - **Horizontal distance**: The angle affects the trajectory and distance traveled horizontally.

3. **Height of highest point**:
   - Does not directly cause any of the other variables given they are primarily results of initial conditions (deformation and angle) rather than causes.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This directly affects the kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. More deformation generally results in more kinetic energy, influencing both the height and horizontal distance the object travels.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the trajectory shape, which directly influences both the height of the highest point (as it determines the vertical component of velocity) and the horizontal distance (as it determines the horizontal component of velocity).

3. **Height of highest point**: This is not a causal factor for the other variables; it is a result of the initial velocity's vertical component.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is not a causal factor for the other variables; it is a result of the initial velocity's horizontal component and is influenced by both the spring's deformation and emergence angle.

### Causality Adjacency Matrix

[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:

- **Matrix[0][2] = 1**: Deformation of the spring affects the height of the highest point by altering the initial vertical velocity.
- **Matrix[0][3] = 1**: Deformation of the spring affects the horizontal distance by changing the initial horizontal velocity.
- **Matrix[1][2] = 1**: Emergence angle affects the height by determining the vertical component of the initial velocity.
- **Matrix[1][3] = 1**: Emergence angle affects the horizontal distance by determining the horizontal component of the initial velocity.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"
