Here’s a logical explanation for the relationships:

1. **Deformation of Spring** (how much the spring is compressed) affects:
   - **Height of Highest Point**: More deformation means more potential energy and thus more height reached. 
   - **Horizontal Distance**: As the launch speed increases, so does the horizontal distance.
   - **Emergence Angle**: Although this doesn’t directly affect the angle, the angle is often set along with deformation for desired outcomes.

2. **Emergence Angle** affects:
   - **Height of Highest Point**: The angle determines how much of the velocity is directed upwards.
   - **Horizontal Distance**: Affects how much of the velocity is directed horizontally.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - Doesn’t directly cause other variables, as it's more of an outcome variable resulting from the initial conditions.

4. **Horizontal Distance**:
   - Doesn’t directly cause other variables, as it's also an outcome variable resulting from the initial conditions.

```

  - Height of the Highest Point (1) because more deformation can lead to a higher trajectory.
  - Horizontal Distance (1) as more energy can propel the object farther.

- **Emergence Angle** causes:

1. **Deformation of spring** is likely to cause changes in both the horizontal distance and the height of the highest point, as the energy stored in the spring will affect the projectile's launch speed.

2. **Emergence angle** will directly affect both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. A higher angle generally results in a greater height and potentially less horizontal distance, depending on the deformation of the spring.

3. **Height of highest point** does not directly cause changes in other variables but is determined by the deformation of the spring and emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance** is similarly a result of the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of spring** affects the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance**. Greater deformation means greater stored energy, resulting in a higher and farther launch.

2. **Emergence angle** influences both the **height of highest point** and **horizontal distance** based on projectile motion physics. The angle determines the trajectory, impacting how high and how far the object goes.

3. **Height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance** are outcomes or effects of the spring deformation and emergence angle but don't cause each other or the other inputs directly.

1. **Deformation of Spring (amount of compression/stretching):**
   - Likely causes both the horizontal distance and height of the projectile's trajectory.
   - Does not directly cause the emergence angle unless manipulated specifically (e.g., varying the spring angle mechanically).

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - Affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance of the projectile.
   - Does not directly cause deformation of the spring.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - Influenced by the emergence angle and deformation of the spring.
   - Does not directly cause changes in other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - Also influenced by the emergence angle and deformation of the spring.
