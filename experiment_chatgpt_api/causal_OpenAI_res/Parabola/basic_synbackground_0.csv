1. **Deformation of Spring**:
   - When a spring is compressed or extended, it stores potential energy.
   - This energy translates to kinetic energy when the spring is released, affecting both the height and horizontal distance reached by the object.
   - Thus, deformation of the spring influences the emergence angle (due to the force applied) and both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - The angle at which the object is projected affects how high and how far it travels.
   - Therefore, the emergence angle influences the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - The height is influenced by the force (deformation of the spring) and the emergence angle.
   - It does not directly influence other variables but is an outcome of them.

4. **Horizontal Distance**:
   - The horizontal distance is influenced by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.
   - It’s also an outcome rather than influencing other variables directly.

```

   - This directly affects the force applied to the object, hence affecting variables like horizontal distance, height, and emergence angle.

2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - This affects the trajectory of the object, influencing both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - This is influenced by both the spring deformation (because it affects the initial velocity) and the emergence angle. It doesn't have a direct causal influence on other variables.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: The amount the spring is compressed or stretched. This directly impacts the launch speed and, consequently, the height and distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which the object is launched. This affects the trajectory, specifically the horizontal distance and height reached.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: The peak height of the trajectory which depends on the speed imparted by the spring and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: The range of the trajectory, determined by both the spring's deformation (affecting speed) and the angle.

- **Deformation of Spring** causes both the **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** (variables 3 and 4) because greater deformation means more potential energy, leading to higher speed and therefore greater both vertical and horizontal reach.

- **Emergence Angle** also influences both the **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** because the angle at which an object is launched affects how high and how far it will travel.

1. **Deformation of spring**: Influences the energy stored in the spring, affecting both vertical and horizontal components of motion.
2. **Emergence angle**: Influences the direction and components of the projectile's motion. Affects horizontal and vertical distances.
3. **Height of highest point**: Determined by the energy and angle directed in the vertical direction.

  - Causes the **emergence angle** (direction of motion depends on initial force).
  - Causes the **height of highest point** (energy affects vertical reach).
  - Causes the **horizontal distance** (energy affects horizontal travel).

- **Emergence angle (2nd row)**:

1. **Deformation of spring**: This affects the force with which the object is launched. More deformation generally means more potential energy, resulting in a larger force applied to the object.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. The angle determines the distribution of initial velocity into vertical and horizontal components.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is affected by both the initial velocity (related to deformation of the spring) and the emergence angle, as these determine how high the projectile can rise.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is also affected by the initial velocity and emergence angle, as they determine how far the projectile will travel.

Given these considerations, we can outline the following causal relationships:

- Deformation of spring causes height of highest point and horizontal distance.
- Emergence angle causes height of highest point and horizontal distance.

The causality adjacency matrix would then look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],]
```

Explanation:

- The deformation of spring influences both the height and horizontal distance due to its effect on initial velocity.
- The emergence angle affects the height and horizontal distance due to how it directs the initial velocity vector.
- Height of highest point and horizontal distance do not directly cause changes in other variables in this model.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of spring**: This directly affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance because it determines the initial potential energy, which converts into kinetic energy affecting the motion.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance, as the trajectory will vary with the angle at which the object is released.

3. **Height of highest point**: This does not directly cause changes in other variables, but is affected by deformation and angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**: Like height, this is affected by deformation and angle, but does not directly cause changes in other variables.
