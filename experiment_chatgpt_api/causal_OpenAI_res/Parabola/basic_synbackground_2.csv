1. **Deformation of Spring**: Directly relates to the potential energy available for the projectile's motion.

2. **Emergence Angle**: Affects both the projectile's height and range.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: Influenced by both the energy imparted by the spring and the angle of launch.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Affected by the energy/potential imparted by spring deformation and the launch angle.

### Causality Analysis

1. **Deformation of Spring**: 
   - Causes both the vertical and horizontal components of motion, affecting the emergence angle aspect indirectly through the force imparted.
   - Directly affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**: 
   - Directly affects the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: 
   - Influenced by spring deformation and launch angle but doesn't directly cause other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: 
   - Influenced by spring deformation and launch angle but doesn't cause other variables.

### Matrix Construction
Using this breakdown, the adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],  # Deformation -> Height, Distance
 [0, 0, 1, 1],  # Emergence Angle -> Height, Distance
 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Height -> None
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Horizontal Distance -> None

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of spring**: 
   - Affects **Emergence angle** (matrix[0][1] = 1): The deformation can influence the direction/angle at which an object is released if the mechanism doesn't perfectly align.
   - Affects **Height of highest point** (matrix[0][2] = 1): The energy stored in the spring (from deformation) translates into kinetic energy, affecting how high the object goes.
   - Affects **Horizontal distance** (matrix[0][3] = 1): Similarly, more deformation leads to more energy, affecting how far the object travels.

2. **Emergence angle**:
   - Affects **Height of highest point** (matrix[1][2] = 1): The angle of launch affects the vertical component of velocity, influencing height.
   - Affects **Horizontal distance** (matrix[1][3] = 1): The angle affects the horizontal component of velocity, influencing distance. 

3. **Height of highest point** and **Horizontal distance** do not directly cause other variables in this context.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This does not directly cause changes to other variables but is affected by both spring deformation and emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of spring:**
   - It affects the **emergence angle** (depends on the setup of the spring and how it releases an object).
   - It impacts the **height of the highest point** because the more energy stored in the spring, the higher an object can go.
   - It affects the **horizontal distance** since more energy means a greater distance traveled.

2. **Emergence angle:**
   - It influences the **height of the highest point** (a steeper angle may result in a higher trajectory).
   - It affects the **horizontal distance** (an optimal angle will result in the maximum distance).

3. **Height of highest point:**
   - Does not directly cause changes in other variables but is an effect of changes in the spring deformation and emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance:**
   - Similar to the height of the highest point, it results from the manipulation of other variables without directly causing changes in them.

   - Affects both the height and the horizontal distance of the projectile trajectory.

### Explanations:

1. **Deformation of Spring (1st row):**
   - **Emergence Angle:** The deformation of the spring can affect the initial force and direction, influencing the emergence angle due to variances in horizontal and vertical components.
   - **Height of Highest Point:** Greater deformation typically results in more potential energy, causing a greater vertical component in motion, and thus a greater height.
   - **Horizontal Distance:** Greater deformation generally results in more potential energy being converted to kinetic energy, increasing horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle (2nd row):**
   - **Height of Highest Point:** The angle affects how much of the force is directed upwards versus forwards, impacting the height of the trajectory.
   - **Horizontal Distance:** The angle also influences how far the projectile travels horizontally.

3. **Height of Highest Point (3rd row):**
   - **No direct causation:** It does not directly cause changes in the other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance (4th row):**
   - **No direct causation:** It does not directly cause changes in the other variables.

Here's the reasoning for the relations:

1. **Deformation of spring**: This represents the potential energy stored in the spring. The more it's deformed, the more energy is available, affecting the projectile's speed and distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the projectile is launched affects how high and how far it will go.

3. **Height of highest point**: This depends on both the initial speed of the projectile (from the spring) and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is affected by the same factors as the height—the initial speed (from the spring's deformation) and the emergence angle. 

Based on these considerations, here's a potential causality matrix:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:

- **Deformation of spring** affects:
  - Emergence angle: If not directly, indirectly through mechanical configurations.
  - Height of highest point: More deformation typically means higher initial speed.
  - Horizontal distance: More speed usually results in a longer distance.

- **Emergence angle** affects:
  - Height of highest point: A higher angle can lead to a higher point.
  - Horizontal distance: Different angles alter the trajectory path and distance.

- **Height of highest point** and **Horizontal distance** do not directly cause changes in other variables in this simplified setup. They are outcomes rather than causing factors. 

This model assumes an ideal scenario without other influencing factors like air resistance, friction, or mechanical limitations. Adjustments might be needed with more detailed system characteristics.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

- **Deformation of Spring (1)** causes:
  - **Emergence Angle (2)**: Increased deformation may affect stability and precision somewhat during launch setup.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This is related to the potential energy stored in the spring, which affects the initial velocity of the projectile.

4. **Horizontal distance**: Determined by the horizontal component of the initial velocity and the time of flight (which depends on emergence angle and initial speed from spring deformation).
