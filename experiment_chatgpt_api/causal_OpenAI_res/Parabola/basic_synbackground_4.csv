1. **Deformation of Spring**:
   - Affects the initial energy imparted to the projectile.
   - Directly influences the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - Affects the trajectory of the projectile.
   - Influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:

1. **Deformation of Spring (Input/Control Variable):** 
   - Increases in spring deformation typically result in an increase in both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance, assuming constant mass and negligible air resistance. 

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. A larger angle typically results in a greater height but potentially less horizontal distance (for angles greater than 45°).
   
3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - Influenced by the spring deformation and emergence angle, but does not typically affect other factors directly in simple mechanics.

4. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - Influenced by both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, as these determine the kinetic energy and trajectory of the launched object.

Considering these relationships, the adjacency matrix would look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Row 1 (Deformation of Spring):** 
  - Causes changes in both the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
- **Row 2 (Emergence Angle):**
  - Causes changes in both the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
- **Row 3 (Height of Highest Point):**
  - Does not directly cause changes in the other variables.
- **Row 4 (Horizontal Distance):**
  - Does not directly cause changes in the other variables.

1. **Deformation of spring**: When you compress a spring, it stores potential energy. This stored energy determines the initial velocity of an object when the spring is released, impacting how far and high the object travels.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This is the initial force exerted by the spring and directly affects both the vertical and horizontal components of the projectile's motion.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the object is launched influences the trajectory, affecting both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is directly influenced by both the deformation (initial force) and the emergence angle, as these affect the vertical motion.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is primarily influenced by the deformation (which affects speed) and the emergence angle (which affects reach).

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],

```

### Explanation:

- **Deformation of spring** affects:
  - Emergence angle: indirectly by the constraints of mechanical interaction, but it's more appropriate to assume this is influenced mainly by design or setting, so the direct link is more from the emergence angle to other output measures.
  - Height of highest point: 1 (as it directly affects potential energy converted to height).
  - Horizontal distance: 1 (as it provides kinetic energy for horizontal reach).

- **Emergence angle** affects:
  - Height of highest point: 1 (determines the vertical component of the velocity).
  - Horizontal distance: 1 (determines the horizontal component of the velocity).

- The **Height of highest point** and **Horizontal distance** are results of the initial conditions and do not cause other factors in this scenario.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of spring** (how much the spring is compressed initially) influences the initial velocity of the object, and thus the height and horizontal distance.
2. **Emergence angle** (angle at which the object is released) influences both the height and the horizontal distance the object will travel.
3. **Height of highest point** is influenced by both the initial velocity (from deformation) and the emergence angle due to projectile motion dynamics.
4. **Horizontal distance** is also influenced by both the initial velocity and emergence angle.

Based on this, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Deformation of spring** causes:
  - **Height of highest point** (more compression, higher potential energy, more height given the same angle).
  - **Horizontal distance** (more compression typically results in greater horizontal travel, given the same angle).
  
- **Emergence angle** causes:
  - **Height of highest point** (a steeper angle increases max height, up to 90 degrees).
  - **Horizontal distance** (an optimal angle around 45 degrees maximizes range).

No other direct causal relationships exist in this context. The height of the highest point and horizontal distance are outcomes influenced by spring deformation and emergence angle.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of Spring (Variable 1)**: The amount by which the spring is compressed or stretched. This directly impacts the potential energy stored in the spring.

2. **Emergence Angle (Variable 2)**: The angle at which the object leaves the spring. This affects the trajectory of the object.

3. **Height of Highest Point (Variable 3)**: The maximum height reached by the object. This is affected by both the speed (related to the spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance (Variable 4)**: The distance traveled horizontally by the object. This is influenced by the initial speed and the emergence angle.

Using the physics of projectile motion:

- **Deformation of Spring** influences both the **Height of Highest Point** and the **Horizontal Distance**, as it affects the initial velocity of the projectile.
  
- **Emergence Angle** influences both the **Height of Highest Point** and the **Horizontal Distance**, as it determines the trajectory.

- There is no direct causation between **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** as they are both results of the initial velocity and angle.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance because the potential energy stored in the spring translates into kinetic energy. Greater deformation usually means greater energy transfer.

2. **Emergence angle**: This predominantly influences the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance separately. A steeper angle may result in a higher trajectory (higher point) while a shallower angle may result in a longer distance.

3. **Height of highest point and Horizontal distance**: While these two are results of the first two variables, they don’t generally cause each other directly. They might have some correlation, but not direct causation.
