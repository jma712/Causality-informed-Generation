1. **Deformation of spring**: The more a spring is compressed (or stretched), the more energy is stored, affecting the speed of the object when released, which in turn influences the height and horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle affects the trajectory, which determines both the height and the horizontal distance.

### Explanation
- **Deformation of Spring** causes emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance because the stored energy affects all these variables.
- **Emergence Angle** influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance since it alters the trajectory components. 

No other direct causal relationships are evident among these given variables.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

Use the identified relationships to complete the causality adjacency matrix and provide a brief explanation supporting your conclusions.There are 4 variables: 
1. Deformation of spring

Please fill this causality adjacency matrix:

 [_, _, _, _],
 [_, _, _, _],
 [_, _, _, _],]
```.
In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To analyze the causal relationships between the variables: 

1. **Deformation of spring**: Affects both the energy stored and the initial speed of the object when released.
2. **Emergence angle**: Influences the trajectory shape, affecting height and horizontal distance.
3. **Height of highest point**: Determined by the initial speed and angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: Determined by speed, angle, and time of flight.

Let's fill the causality adjacency matrix:

- **Deformation of spring** (1) causes:
  - Height of highest point (3)
  - Horizontal distance (4)

- **Emergence angle** (2) causes:
  - Height of highest point (3)
  - Horizontal distance (4)

Based on these observations:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:

- The deformation of the spring directly affects the potential energy converted to kinetic energy, impacting both height and distance.
- The emergence angle affects the vertical and horizontal components of initial velocity, influencing both height and distance.
- Height and distance do not directly cause changes in deformation or angle in this setup.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, we'll consider how each variable potentially affects the others:

1. **Deformation of spring**: The initial deformation of the spring affects the force exerted by the spring, which in turn can affect the **emergence angle**, **height of the highest point**, and **horizontal distance**.

2. **Emergence angle**: The angle at which the object is launched will affect the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance**.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is generally the result of the initial kinetic energy imparted by the spring and the angle, and primarily doesn't directly influence other variables.

4. **Horizontal distance**: Like height, this is generally a result rather than a cause.

Given the above reasoning, the matrix can be filled as follows:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:
- **Deformation of spring** affects emergence angle, height, and horizontal distance due to the energy and force it exerts.
- **Emergence angle** affects both height and horizontal distance due to projectile motion physics.
- **Height** and **horizontal distance** are outcomes and do not directly influence other variables in this scenario.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"
