   - Directly affects both height and horizontal distance of the projectile.
   
3. **Height of Highest Point (3)**
   - Affected by both the deformation (via initial kinetic energy) and angle.

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of Spring:**
   - **Emergence Angle**: The deformation can affect the angle at which the object is projected if the shape of the spring or surrounding mechanisms guide the object’s initial trajectory.
   - **Height of Highest Point & Horizontal Distance**: More deformation generally means more stored energy, which converts to greater kinetic energy, affecting how high and far the object can travel.

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - **Height of Highest Point & Horizontal Distance**: The angle impacts the distribution of energy between vertical and horizontal components. A steeper angle generally increases the height, while a shallower angle increases horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - Typically does not directly cause changes in other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - **Height of Highest Point**: Can affect it indirectly since, for a given energy, horizontal range and height vary with angle. However, the primary causes of height are deformation and angle, rather than horizontal distance directly.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of spring** can affect the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** because the amount of deformation determines the force exerted, affecting both vertical and horizontal movement.
2. **Emergence angle** can affect both the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** by changing the direction of the force applied by the spring.
3. The **height of the highest point** is primarily affected by the other two variables and does not directly affect them.
4. The **horizontal distance** is also affected by the other two variables and does not directly cause changes in them.

1. **Deformation of Spring:**
   - Directly affects the **Height of the Highest Point** as greater deformation stores more potential energy, resulting in a higher launch.

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - Directly affects both the **Height of the Highest Point** and the **Horizontal Distance**. A higher angle generally increases the height but reduces the distance, while a lower angle increases distance but reduces height.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - Typically an outcome of spring deformation and emergence angle and doesn’t directly cause changes in the other variables.

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of Spring:**

   - Causes Height of Highest Point: Greater deformation generally provides more energy, affecting how high the object goes.
   - Causes Horizontal Distance: The deformation affects the energy and hence the distance traveled.

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - Causes Height of Highest Point: The angle of release affects the trajectory and hence the maximum height.
   - Causes Horizontal Distance: The angle also affects the distance due to the change in the trajectory.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - Causes Horizontal Distance: The height achieved during the motion impacts the time of flight, which in turn affects the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which the object is launched affects the trajectory, including both horizontal distance and height.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is influenced by both the initial kinetic energy (related to spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: Influenced by the initial energy (spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To fill out the causality adjacency matrix, let's consider the relationship between the variables in a typical physical scenario involving a spring:

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This refers to how much the spring is compressed or stretched.
2. **Emergence Angle**: This is the angle at which an object leaves the spring's resting position.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is how high the object goes after being launched.
4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is the distance the object travels horizontally after being launched.

### Assumptions:
- A more deformed spring will exert more force, affecting the emergence angle, height, and distance.
- The emergence angle can affect the height and horizontal distance.
- The height of the highest point is influenced by the spring's deformation and the emergence angle.
- Horizontal distance is influenced by both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

### Causal Relationships:
1. **Deformation of Spring (1)** causes:
   - Emergence Angle (2): Greater deformation likely leads to a stronger release force, potentially affecting the angle.
   - Height of Highest Point (3): Directly affects how much force propels the object upwards.
   - Horizontal Distance (4): Directly affects how much force propels the object forward.

2. **Emergence Angle (2)** causes:
   - Height of Highest Point (3): A higher angle results in a higher peak.
   - Horizontal Distance (4): Determines the range along with the amount of force.

3. **Height of Highest Point (3)** is affected by:
   - Deformation of Spring (1): Impacts the initial upward velocity.
   - Emergence Angle (2): Impacts how the initial kinetic energy is divided between vertical and horizontal components.

4. **Horizontal Distance (4)** is affected by:
   - Deformation of Spring (1): Impacts the initial horizontal velocity.
   - Emergence Angle (2): Similar to height, it divides initial velocity energy between horizontal and vertical.

Given these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix can be filled as follows:

 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
