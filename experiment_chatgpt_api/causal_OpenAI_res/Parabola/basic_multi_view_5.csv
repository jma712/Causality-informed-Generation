1. **Deformation of Spring**: This affects the initial force (and thus the initial velocity) imparted to a projectile.
2. **Emergence Angle**: This affects the trajectory.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is determined by both initial velocity and emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is determined by both the initial velocity (deformation of spring) and the emergence angle.

### Explanation
- The **Deformation of Spring** directly causes changes in emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance due to its influence on initial velocity.
- The **Emergence Angle** affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance by determining the trajectory shape.
- **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** are results, not causes, in this scenario.

Here's a general reasoning based on physics:

1. **Deformation of Spring**: The deformation of the spring will affect the initial force applied, impacting the angle of emergence and the horizontal distance.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which an object is launched influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance it travels. 

3. **Height of Highest Point**: The height reached does not directly cause changes in other variables; instead, it is influenced by them.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: The horizontal distance is affected by the deformation of the spring and the angle of emergence.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

- The deformation of the spring influences the emergence angle and horizontal distance.
- The emergence angle influences the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
- Height of the highest point does not have a direct causal effect on any other variable in this simplified model.
- Horizontal distance is a result of the other factors and does not influence them in return within this context.","[[0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This depends on the initial speed (from spring deformation) and the angle of emergence.

Given these relationships, the causality can be described as follows:

- **Deformation of Spring** affects:
  - Emergence Angle: No direct effect, unless a mechanism links these (not typically assumed).
  - Height of Highest Point: Yes, because it affects the initial speed.
  - Horizontal Distance: Yes, by influencing the initial speed.

- **Emergence Angle** affects:
  - Deformation of Spring: No, angle does not affect the spring deformation.
  - Height of Highest Point: Yes, affects the vertical component of motion.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This affects the initial force and thus the initial velocity of the projectile.
2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the trajectory, influencing both the height and the horizontal distance.
3. **Height of highest point**: This is influenced by both the initial velocity (affected by deformation of the spring) and the emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: This is influenced by the initial velocity and the emergence angle.

- Deformation of spring causes height of the highest point and horizontal distance due to its influence on the initial velocity.
- Emergence angle causes height of the highest point and horizontal distance as it determines the trajectory.

 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation

- **Deformation of Spring**:
  - Affects the **Emergence Angle** if it's variable, but mostly it affects how far and how high the object can go due to speed: (0,1,1,1)
  
- **Emergence Angle**:
  - Directly impacts both **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance**, because it determines the trajectory: (0,0,1,1)
  
- **Height of Highest Point**: 
  - Does not directly cause changes in other variables, as it is an outcome of speed and angle: (0,0,0,0)
  
- **Horizontal Distance**:
  - Also an outcome and doesnâ€™t impact initial launch conditions: (0,0,0,0)

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of spring** can influence:
   - The **emergence angle** (1): How the spring is deformed can affect the angle at which an object is launched.
   - The **height of the highest point** (1): More deformation generally means more energy, leading to a higher point.
   - The **horizontal distance** (1): Greater deformation can increase the energy transfer, affecting how far the object travels horizontally.

2. **Emergence angle** can influence:
   - The **height of the highest point** (1): The angle affects the trajectory, hence affecting the peak height.
   - The **horizontal distance** (1): The trajectory angle also impacts how far the object will travel horizontally. 

3. **Height of the highest point** does not directly cause changes in other variables in this context.

4. **Horizontal distance** does not directly cause changes in other variables in this context.

Here's a breakdown of the potential causal relationships:

1. **Deformation of Spring**:
   - Affects the launch velocity, influencing both the horizontal distance and maximum height.
   
2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - Influences the trajectories, affecting both the maximum height and the horizontal distance of the projectile.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - Determined by the combination of launch velocity and emergence angle. It does not directly cause other variables.

4. **Horizontal Distance**:
   - Determined by the combination of launch velocity and emergence angle. It does not affect other initial conditions.

Based on these considerations, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],

### Variables:
1. **Deformation of spring**: Affects the potential energy and force exerted on the projectile.
2. **Emergence angle**: Determines the trajectory shape, affecting both height and horizontal distance.
3. **Height of highest point**: Influenced by initial velocity and angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: Influenced by initial velocity and angle.

### Causal Relationships:

1. **Deformation of spring**:
   - Directly affects the initial velocity and thus the **height of highest point** and **horizontal distance**.

2. **Emergence angle**:
   - Affects the trajectory, influencing both the **height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance**.

3. **Height of highest point**:
   - Typically a resultant variable influenced by initial conditions but doesn't directly cause others.

4. **Horizontal distance**:
   - Similar to height, it is a resultant variable, influenced by the initial conditions but doesnâ€™t directly cause others.

### Matrix:

 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Horizontal distance doesn't cause other variables

```

### Explanation:
- The initial deformation of the spring imparts kinetic energy, affecting how high (height) and how far (distance) the object can travel.
- The angle of emergence determines the trajectory, influencing both the height and distance traveled.
- The height and distance are outcomes dependent on above variables and do not influence each other directly.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"
