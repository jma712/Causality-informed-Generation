**Possible Causal Relationships:**

1. **Deformation of Spring:**
   - This is the initial condition that affects the energy transferred to the object, influencing both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. It possibly influences the emergence angle if the deformation affects the release mechanism angle.

2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - The angle at which the projectile is released influences the balance between vertical and horizontal motion, impacting the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.

3. **Height of Highest Point:**
   - This is influenced by the energy transferred from the spring and the emergence angle but doesn’t directly cause changes in other variables in this context.

4. **Horizontal Distance:**
   - It is influenced by the spring's deformation (energy) and emergence angle but doesn’t directly cause changes in other variables.

- **Row 1 (Deformation of Spring):**  
  - Causes changes in emergence angle (since deformation might affect release mechanics directly), height, and horizontal distance due to the energy transfer involved.

- **Row 2 (Emergence Angle):**  
  - Influences the height and horizontal distance due to the way it affects the trajectory.

   - **Height of highest point** (3): More deformation generally results in higher launch speed, leading to a higher peak.
   - **Horizontal distance** (4): More deformation implies more stored energy, leading to greater distance.

2. **Emergence angle** (2) affects:
   - **Height of highest point** (3): A steeper angle typically results in a higher peak.
   - **Horizontal distance** (4): Affects the range due to the impact of angle on trajectory.

3. **Height of highest point** (3):

2. **Emergence Angle**: This affects both the height and the distance the object travels.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is directly influenced by the emergence angle and initial energy from the spring.

1. **Deformation of spring** (Variable 1): 
   - Greater deformation increases the potential energy stored in the spring, impacting the initial velocity of the object as it's launched.
  
2. **Emergence angle** (Variable 2):
   - The angle at which the object is launched affects its trajectory, hence influencing the height and horizontal distance traveled.
  
3. **Height of highest point** (Variable 3):
   - This is dependent on the initial velocity and the angle of launch and doesn't directly cause other variables.
  
4. **Horizontal distance** (Variable 4):
   - This is affected by the initial velocity and the angle of launch.

### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of spring:**
   - **Causes Emergence angle (1):** The compression of the spring affects the angle at which the projectile emerges.
   - **Causes Height of highest point (1):** A greater deformation increases the vertical component of the velocity, affecting the height.
   - **Causes Horizontal distance (1):** The horizontal component of the velocity is affected by the power from the spring.

2. **Emergence angle:**
   - **Causes Horizontal distance (1):** The angle at which the projectile is launched affects how far it travels horizontally.

3. **Height of highest point:**
   - **Causes Horizontal distance (1):** The maximum height reached can influence the time of flight and thus the horizontal distance, but it's mostly a direct consequence of the launch parameters, so in this simple model, it isn't directly causing horizontal distance changes without other parameters influencing it.

4. **Horizontal distance:**
   - **No outgoing causal links (0):** This is usually an outcome variable in such experiments.

This structure assumes the deformation is the primary input variable affecting the emergence angle, height, and horizontal distance. The angle can also influence the distance due to the physics of projectile motion.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of spring**: Typically affects the energy stored and thus influences other outcomes like the angle, height, and distance.
2. **Emergence angle**: Influences how far and high the projectile will travel.
3. **Height of highest point**: Depends on both the energy (from the deformation of the spring) and the emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of spring (1)**
2. **Emergence angle (2)**
3. **Height of highest point (3)**
4. **Horizontal distance (4)**

Assumptions based on physics:

- The deformation of a spring affects how much potential energy is stored in the spring, which influences the initial velocity of the object being projected. This can affect both the emergence angle and the energy available for height and distance.
- The emergence angle influences the vertical and horizontal components of velocity.
- Both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance will be influenced by the initial energy projected from the spring and the angle.

### Explanation:

- **Deformation of spring (1):**
  - Causes **Emergence angle (2):** The force applied can depend on the spring deformation if the spring is released at a non-fixed angle, although typically design limits this variable. For simplicity we may assume limited effect, but in setups where angle isn't constant it could affect angle through dynamics.
  - Causes **Height of highest point (3):** More deformation generally means more energy available to reach a higher point.
  - Causes **Horizontal distance (4):** More deformation imparts more energy, thus can result in traveling a further horizontal distance.

- **Emergence angle (2):**
  - Causes **Height of highest point (3):** The vertical component of velocity determines the maximum height.
  - Causes **Horizontal distance (4):** The angle affects how much of the velocity contributes to horizontal distance.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Deformation of Spring**: Compressing a spring stores potential energy, which affects both the kinetic energy imparted to an object when released and its trajectory.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which the object leaves the spring affects the object’s trajectory, including the height and horizontal distance traveled.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is influenced by the initial speed and the angle of projection.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This depends on the initial speed, angle of projection, and indirectly on the height of the projectile.

Considering these points, we can deduce the following causal relationships:

- The deformation of the spring causes changes in both the emergence angle (depending on how the setup alters release) and the height of the highest point.
- The emergence angle affects the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance (as it changes the trajectory).
- The height of the highest point is mainly a result of the emergence angle and initial force but doesn't directly affect the other variables.
- The horizontal distance is caused by both the deformation of the spring (imparting initial velocity) and the emergence angle (trajectory).
