1. **Deformation of spring**: Affects the force exerted by the spring. More deformation means more stored potential energy, which translates to more kinetic energy when released.

2. **Emergence angle**: Affects the initial direction of the launched object, impacting both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

3. **Height of highest point**: Directly influenced by both the deformation of the spring (initial velocity) and the emergence angle (trajectory).

4. **Horizontal distance**: Similarly influenced by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of Spring**:
   - This is the initial factor that determines the potential energy stored in the spring. When released, this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, causing the projectile to move.

2. **Emergence Angle**:
   - This is determined by the configuration of the system and is likely independent directly from the deformation of the spring, but it affects the trajectory.

3. **Height of Highest Point**:
   - This is affected by the initial velocity (from the spring deformation) and the emergence angle. Both influence how high the projectile will go.

4. **Horizontal Distance**:
   - This is determined by the initial velocity and the emergence angle as well. The more deformed the spring, the further the projectile can potentially travel. The emergence angle affects the range of the projectile.

Based on these relationships, we can fill the causality adjacency matrix as follows:

3. **Height of highest point**: Determined by initial kinetic energy (from spring deformation) and angle.

1. **Deformation of spring**: 
   - Likely affects the **emergence angle** because the force exerted can influence the initial angle of release.
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** since both are influenced by the amount of energy stored in the spring (height and range are proportional to the spring force when angled).

2. **Emergence angle**:
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance** because these are influenced by the launch angle in projectile motion.

3. **Height of highest point**:
   - Generally does not cause any other variables in this context but is a result of the spring deformation and emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal distance**:
   - Like the height, it does not cause other variables but results from spring deformation and emergence angle.

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],

- `matrix[0][1] = 1`: Deformation of spring causes emergence angle.
- `matrix[0][2] = 1` and `matrix[0][3] = 1`: Deformation of spring causes height and horizontal distance.
- `matrix[1][2] = 1` and `matrix[1][3] = 1`: Emergence angle affects height and horizontal distance.

Here's a breakdown of potential causal relationships:

1. **Deformation of spring**: Typically affects both the vertical and horizontal motion, thus influencing the emergence angle, height of the highest point, and horizontal distance.
2. **Emergence angle**: Influences the trajectory, affecting the height of the highest point and horizontal distance.
3. **Height of highest point**: Depends on the initial conditions (deformation and emergence angle).
4. **Horizontal distance**: Depends on all the previous variables but doesn't affect them directly.

Given these considerations, the adjacency matrix can be:

```
[[0, 1, 1, 1],  # Deformation of spring affects emergence angle, height, and horizontal distance
 [0, 0, 1, 1],  # Emergence angle affects height and horizontal distance
 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Height of the highest point does not cause other variables directly
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Horizontal distance does not cause other variables directly
```

### Explanation:

- **Deformation of spring**: Directly affects how the spring releases the object, thereby affecting the initial speed and trajectory angle.
- **Emergence angle**: Determines the direction of the projectile, which directly impacts the height reached and the distance traveled.
- **Height of highest point** and **horizontal distance**: Are results of the dynamics but do not influence the other parameters.","[[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"

Here's a typical structured way to view these variables:

1. **Deformation of Spring**: Affects the energy stored in the spring.
2. **Emergence Angle**: Affects the trajectory.
3. **Height of Highest Point**: Depends on the initial vertical component of velocity.
4. **Horizontal Distance**: Depends on the horizontal component of the initial velocity.

Now, assessing the causal relationships:

- The **deformation of the spring** affects both the **height of the highest point** and the **horizontal distance**, as it influences the initial velocity (both vertical and horizontal components).
- The **emergence angle** affects both the **height of the highest point** and **horizontal distance** as it determines the distribution of the initial velocity into vertical and horizontal components.

Filling the matrix based on these relationships:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

**Explanation:**

- Row 0 (Deformation of Spring):
  - Affects Height of Highest Point: 1
  - Affects Horizontal Distance: 1

- Row 1 (Emergence Angle):
  - Affects Height of Highest Point: 1
  - Affects Horizontal Distance: 1

- Height and distance are outputs determined by the first two variables, so they have no causal arrows pointing from them to others.","[[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]"
