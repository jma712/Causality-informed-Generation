2. **Emergence Angle:**
   - Affects both the **Horizontal Distance** and the **Height of the Highest Point**. The angle at which an object is launched influences how far and how high it will go.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is determined by the initial velocity (impacted by spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This is impacted by the initial velocity (spring deformation) and the emergence angle.

### Causality Matrix

Based on the above analysis:

- Deformation of spring influences both the horizontal distance and the height of the highest point.
- Emergence angle influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance.

- **Deformation of Spring to Horizontal Distance**: More deformation results in more energy, leading to longer distance traveled.
- **Emergence Angle to Height of Highest Point**: Affects the vertical component of the velocity, determining how high the projectile reaches.

2. **Emergence angle**: Determines the direction of the object's trajectory, which affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance covered.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is an outcome rather than a direct cause. It's influenced by both the energy transfer from the spring (deformation) and the emergence angle.

1. **Deformation of spring**: This represents how much the spring is compressed or extended.

2. **Emergence angle**: This is the angle at which the object is projected.

3. **Height of highest point**: This is the maximum height reached by the object.

4. **Horizontal distance**: This is the distance traveled horizontally by the object.

### Causality Analysis:

1. **Deformation of Spring** causes both **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance**:
   - The more a spring is deformed (compressed), the more potential energy it stores. This energy is converted to kinetic energy, affecting both the height and distance.

2. **Emergence Angle** affects both **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance**:
   - The angle of projection determines the trajectory, which affects how high and how far the object will travel.

3. **Deformation of Spring** does not directly cause **Emergence Angle** or vice versa unless there's a specific mechanism enforcing this relationship.
   
4. **Height of Highest Point** and **Horizontal Distance** do not cause further changes to **Deformation of Spring** or **Emergence Angle** once set.
