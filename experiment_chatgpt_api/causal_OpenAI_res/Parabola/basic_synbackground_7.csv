### Explanation:

1. **Deformation of spring:** 
   - Causes the **emergence angle** because the initial force and spring compression can affect the direction of launch.
   - Affects **height of the highest point** because more potential energy in the spring can lead to a higher trajectory.

2. **Emergence angle:**
   - Affects the **height of the highest point** since a steeper angle generally increases the height.
   - Influences the **horizontal distance** as the angle is crucial in determining range vs height trade-offs.

3. **Height of highest point:**
   - Directly impacts the **horizontal distance** because being higher typically allows for more time in the air, thus potentially covering more distance.

2. **Emergence angle**: This affects the trajectory path.
3. **Height of highest point**: This is affected by both the initial velocity and the emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: This is also affected by the initial velocity and the emergence angle.

### Causal Relationships:

1. **Deformation of spring causes Height of highest point**: The more the spring is deformed (compressed or extended), the greater the initial velocity, resulting in a higher apex of the trajectory.
2. **Deformation of spring causes Horizontal distance**: Similarly, a higher initial velocity due to more spring deformation increases the horizontal distance traveled.
3. **Emergence angle causes Height of highest point**: The angle of launch will determine the vertical component of the velocity, affecting the maximum height.
4. **Emergence angle causes Horizontal distance**: The angle also impacts the horizontal component of velocity, thus affecting horizontal range.

3. **Height of highest point**: Determined by both spring deformation and emergence angle.
4. **Horizontal distance**: Also influenced by spring deformation and emergence angle.

- `matrix[1][2]` and `matrix[1][3]` are `1` because the emergence angle affects both outcomes (height and distance) by determining the trajectory angle.

1. **Deformation of spring**: The energy stored in the spring (and thus its deformation) directly affects how far and how high the object will travel.
2. **Emergence angle**: This angle influences both the highest point reached and the horizontal distance traveled.
3. **Height of highest point**: This is influenced by both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle, but typically doesn't cause other variables.
4. **Horizontal distance**: This is influenced by the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.

 [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Height of highest point does not cause any other variables
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Horizontal distance does not cause any other variables
