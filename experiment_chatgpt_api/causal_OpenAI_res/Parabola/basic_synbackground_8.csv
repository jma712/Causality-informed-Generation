2. **Emergence angle**: This influences both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance, as these are components of projectile motion.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: This is the primary input variable. The amount of deformation (compression or extension) will determine the potential energy stored in the spring, which affects how far and at what height the object will travel when released.
  
2. **Emergence Angle**: This may not be directly affected by the deformation of the spring, but rather by how the spring system is set up or oriented. However, it affects the height and the horizontal distance the object will travel.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: The height achieved by the object is affected by both the deformation of the spring (energy input) and the emergence angle.

4. **Horizontal Distance**: This depends on the initial energy (spring deformation) and the emergence angle, influencing the trajectory path.

1. **Deformation of Spring**: The amount of spring deformation affects the initial velocity of the launch, which directly impacts both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance. The emergence angle also plays a role in determining trajectory, so deformation has a causal relationship with these.

2. **Emergence Angle**: The angle at which the object is launched affects both the height of the highest point and the horizontal distance but does not affect the deformation of the spring.

3. **Height of Highest Point**: This is primarily a result of deformation and angle, so it does not directly cause changes in the other variables.

2. **Emergence angle**: This influences how high and how far the object will travel.
3. **Height of highest point**: This is a result influenced by both the initial vertical velocity (affected by deformation and angle) and gravitational forces.
4. **Horizontal distance**: This is influenced by the initial horizontal velocity, which is a function of both the deformation of the spring and the emergence angle.
