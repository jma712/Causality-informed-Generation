Explain: When the object is moved closer to a convex lens, the magnification of the image increases.

A. the magnification increases
B. the magnification will not change

Explain: In optics, as the object distance from a convex lens increases beyond the focal length, the image distance also increases, but at a slower rate. This results in a decrease in magnification, which is defined as the ratio of the image height to the object height. Therefore, moving the object farther from the lens will decrease the magnification.",C,C

Explain: When an object is moved closer to a convex lens, the magnification of the image increases. This is because the image distance increases while the object distance decreases, resulting in a larger magnification as given by the lens formula \( M = \frac{v}{u} \), where \( M \) is magnification, \( v \) is the image distance, and \( u \) is the object distance.",A,A

Explain: When an object is moved closer to the convex lens, the image distance increases and the image becomes larger compared to the object. The magnification, which is the ratio of the image height to the object height, increases as the object gets closer to the focal point of the lens.",A,A

A. the magnification decreases
B. the magnification will not change
C. the magnification increases","The answer is: A. the magnification decreases.

Explain: In optics, the magnification of an image formed by a convex lens is determined by the ratio of the image distance to the object distance (M = v/u). When the object is moved farther from the lens, the object distance (u) increases. Since magnification is inversely proportional to the object distance (u), increasing the object distance causes the magnification to decrease, assuming the image distance (v) adjusts according to the lens equation \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \), where f is the focal length of the lens.",A,A

C. the magnification will not change","The answer is: B. the magnification decreases.

Explain: When an object is moved farther from a convex lens, the image distance decreases while the size of the image also decreases. Magnification, which is the ratio of the image height to the object height, thus decreases because the image becomes smaller relative to the object.",B,B

B. the magnification increases
C. the magnification will not change","The answer is: B. the magnification increases.

Explain: When an object is moved closer to a convex lens, the distance between the object and the lens decreases. As a result, the image distance generally increases, which in turn increases the magnification. This is because magnification is the ratio of the image distance to the object distance, so reducing object distance while increasing image distance leads to greater magnification.",B,B
