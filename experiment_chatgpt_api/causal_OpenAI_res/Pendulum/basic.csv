- **Light Position** causes a change in both the **Shadow Position** and **Shadow Length** due to changes in lighting angle.
- **Pendulum Angle** affects both the **Shadow Position** and **Shadow Length** because its position relative to the light determines shadow direction and size.
- **Pendulum Length** affects only **Shadow Length** because a longer pendulum changes how far the shadow extends without altering its position.","[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

2. **Pendulum angle**:
    - Affects the shadow position directly due to the change in pendulum's angle.

[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1],

```

### Explanation:

1. **Light Position:**
   - Causes Shadow Position: The position of the light changes where the shadow falls.
   - Causes Shadow Length: The position of the light affects how long the shadow is.

2. **Pendulum Angle:**
   - Causes Shadow Position: The angle of the pendulum changes the direction in which the shadow stretches.
   - Causes Shadow Length: The pendulum angle affects how stretched the shadow appears.

3. **Pendulum Length:**
   - Causes Shadow Length: A longer pendulum will create a longer shadow, assuming all other variables remain constant.

4. **Shadow Position and Shadow Length:**
   - These are effects and don't causally influence other variables in this context.","[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To determine the causal relationships between the variables, consider the following:

1. **Light position** affects the **shadow position** and **shadow length**.

4. **Shadow position** is affected by **light position** and **pendulum angle**.
5. **Shadow length** is affected by **light position** and **pendulum length**.

Based on these observations, the causality adjacency matrix is:

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],

- Light position causes shadow position and shadow length.
- Pendulum angle causes shadow position.
- Pendulum length causes shadow length.","[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
