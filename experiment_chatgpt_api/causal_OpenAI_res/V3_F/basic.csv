In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To determine the causal relationships, we need to understand the relationships between the volume of a sphere, the height of a cuboid, and the base area of a cone.

1. The ball's volume does not directly affect the cuboid's height or the cone's base area.
2. The cuboid's height does not directly affect the ball's volume or the cone's base area.
