- The base area and height determine the volume for both cuboids and cones, but not vice versa.

1. Ball's volume
2. Cuboid's height
3. Base area of cuboid
4. Base area of cone

Considering the context and typical understanding of geometry:

- The ball's volume is determined by its radius. It doesn't directly cause changes in the height or base areas of the cuboid or cone.

- The cuboid's volume depends on its height and base area. However, given the variables, it's more relevant to understand causality between height and base area for determining the volume.

- Cone's base area does not cause changes in the height or base area of the cuboid, nor the ball's volume.

The causal relationships focusing on volume for cuboid and shape properties are:

1. Cuboid's base area and height both influence or determine the cuboid's volume.
2. No direct causal relationship between ball's volume and other geometric properties here.
3. No causal impact from or to cone's base area on the others in the context given.
