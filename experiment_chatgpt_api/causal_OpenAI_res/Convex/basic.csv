\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \(d_o\) is the distance from the object to the lens, \(d_i\) is the distance from the image to the lens, and \(f\) is the focal length of the lens. Magnification \(M\) is related to these distances by:

\[
M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

Based on these equations:

1. Changing the distance from the object to the lens (\(d_o\)) affects both the distance from the image to the lens (\(d_i\)) and the magnification (\(M\)).
2. Changing the distance from the image to the lens (\(d_i\)) affects the magnification (\(M\)) but not directly \(d_o\).
3. The magnification (\(M\)) is a result of the relationship between \(d_o\) and \(d_i\), thus it does not directly cause changes in \(d_o\) or \(d_i\).

1. **Distance from object to lens (1) causes the distance from image to lens (2)**: 
   - Using the lens formula, changing \( d_o \) will affect \( d_i \) since \( f \) is constant.

2. **Distance from image to lens (2) causes the distance from object to lens (1)**: 
   - Similarly, changing \( d_i \) will affect \( d_o \).

3. **Distance from object to lens (1) causes Magnification (3)**:
   - Changing \( d_o \) affects \( M \) as evident from the formula \( M = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \).

4. **Distance from image to lens (2) causes Magnification (3)**:
