1. **Lens Formula**: 
   \[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} \]
   - \(d_o\) = distance from object to the convex lens
   - \(d_i\) = distance from image to the convex lens
   - \(f\) = focal length (constant for a given lens)

2. **Magnification (\(M\)) Formula**:
   \[ M = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \]
   - \(h_i\) = image height
   - \(h_o\) = object height

The causal relationships can be inferred as follows:

- The **object distance (\(d_o\))** influences the **image distance (\(d_i\))**. Changing \(d_o\) while keeping focal length consistent affects where the image is formed.
- The **object distance (\(d_o\))** also influences the **magnification (M)** since magnification is dependent on the ratio \(-\frac{d_i}{d_o}\).
- The **image distance (\(d_i\))** influences the **magnification (M)** through the lens formula and the magnification formula.
