1. Spring constant (k)
2. Weight (W)
3. Deformation of spring (x)

### Relationships:
- **Hooke's Law**: \( F = k \cdot x \)
  - Deformation of the spring (x) is directly related to the force applied (F). Here, weight (W) can be considered as the force due to gravity acting on the object.

- **Weight and Deformation**: As the weight increases, the force increases, causing greater deformation. Therefore, weight causes deformation.

- **Spring Constant and Deformation**: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less under the same weight. Therefore, the spring constant affects deformation.

- **Weight (F):** Acts as a force applied to the spring, causing deformation.

- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Based on this:

1. **Spring constant (\( k \))** affects the deformation (\( x \)); a stiffer spring (higher \( k \)) results in less deformation for the same force.

Hooke's Law states that the deformation (or elongation/compression) of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied to it and inversely proportional to the spring constant (F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the deformation).

Based on this, we can make the following conclusions:

1. **Weight causes deformation of spring:** More weight results in increased force, leading to more deformation. Hence, ""weight"" causes ""deformation of spring.""

2. **Spring constant affects deformation of spring:** A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same amount of weight. Thus, ""spring_constant"" causes ""deformation of spring.""

3. **Spring constant does not directly affect weight:** The spring constant is a property of the spring itself and does not influence the weight that is placed on it.

4. **Weight does not change the spring constant:** The spring's inherent characteristics are not altered by changing the weight.

Thus, the causality adjacency matrix is as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- ""spring_constant"" (1st row) affects ""deformation of spring"" (3rd column).
- ""weight"" (2nd row) affects ""deformation of spring"" (3rd column).

Hooke’s Law can be expressed as:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

where \( F \) is the force applied to the spring (related to weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Based on this equation:

1. **Weight (Force) Causes Deformation:** The weight applied to the spring causes it to deform. Thus, an increase in weight increases the deformation.

2. **Spring Constant Affects Deformation:** The spring constant \( k \) affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight. A stiffer spring (higher \( k \)) will deform less.

From this, the causality matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

- **(spring_constant → defomation of spring)** and **(weight → defomation of spring)** are set to 1 since both the spring constant and the weight directly influence the deformation.

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To determine the causal relationships among the variables (spring_constant, weight, deformation of spring), we can use Hooke’s Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the deformation. The relationship is defined as:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied by the weight (which can be directly associated with the ""weight"" variable),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Based on this equation:

1. **Weight** directly causes **Deformation of Spring** (more weight increases deformation).
2. **Spring Constant** influences **Deformation of Spring** (a stiffer spring \(k\) will result in less deformation for the same weight).

Thus, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],

Based on this relationship:

1. **Weight → Deformation of Spring**: The weight provides the force causing the deformation.
