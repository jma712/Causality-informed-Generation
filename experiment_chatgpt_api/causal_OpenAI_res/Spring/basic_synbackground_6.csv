2. **Weight (F):** This is the force applied to the spring, which can cause it to deform.

1. **Spring Constant (k):** Determines the stiffness of the spring; a higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer.

2. **Weight (acting as Force, F):** Causes deformation of the spring. The weight (or force due to gravity) applied on the spring causes it to deform.

1. **Spring constant** (k)
2. **Weight** (w)
3. **Deformation of spring** (d)

The relationship between these variables is governed by Hooke's Law:

\[ F = k \times x \]

Where \( F \) is the force applied (from the weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

### Causal Relationships:

- The **weight** causes **deformation** (weight affects the force causing the spring to deform).
- The **spring constant** affects **deformation** (the spring's stiffness determines how much it will stretch or compress for a given weight).

Based on this understanding, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # Spring constant does not cause weight but causes deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # Weight does not cause spring constant but causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # Deformation is an effect, not a cause in this context

1. Spring constant (\(k\)): 
   - Represents the stiffness of the spring. A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight.
2. Weight (\(F\)): 
   - The force applied by the weight causes the spring to deform.

Using the formula \(F = k \cdot x\), we derive the following causal relationships:

1. The spring constant affects the deformation of the spring.
2. The weight affects the deformation of the spring.

However, there is no direct causal relationship of the deformation on the spring constant or the weight, as \(k\) and \(F\) are independent input variables.

So the causality adjacency matrix is:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force applied to the spring,
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

For a weight \( W \) hanging on a spring, the force due to weight is \( W = mg \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

Given these relationships:

1. **Weight (Force due to gravity)** causes **Deformation of spring**: The weight applies a force causing the spring to deform.
2. **Spring constant** influences the extent of **Deformation of spring** for a given weight: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less under the same weight.

Thus, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** The change in length of the spring due to the applied weight.

According to Hooke’s Law:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force (weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer the causal relationships:

- **Spring Constant (k) causes Deformation (x)**: The value of \( k \) affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight.
- **Weight (W) causes Deformation (x)**: The weight determines the amount of deformation, assuming a fixed \( k \).

Thus:

- \( k \) and \( W \) directly influence \( x \).
- No direct causal relationship from \( x \) to \( k \) or \( W \) because deformation does not determine the weight or the spring constant.
