1. **Hooke's Law**: The deformation (compression or elongation) of a spring is proportional to the force applied, \( F = k \cdot x \), where \( F \) is the force (related to weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation.

- **weight → deformation**: Yes, weight causes deformation (matrix[1][2] = 1), as more weight means more force, leading to more deformation.

Here's an explanation of the causal relationships:

1. **Weight causes deformation of spring.** 
   - The force applied by the weight leads to the deformation of the spring. (Weight is equivalent to force in this context as \( F = mg \), where \( m \) is mass and \( g \) is gravitational acceleration).

2. **Spring constant affects deformation of spring.**
   - The stiffness of the spring, represented by the spring constant, determines how much the spring deforms under a certain force.

1. **Spring constant (k):** Determines how stiff the spring is.
2. **Weight (F):** The force applied to the spring, which can cause deformation.
3. **Deformation of spring (x):** The change in length of the spring from its equilibrium position.

According to Hooke's Law:
\[ F = k \cdot x \]

From this equation, we infer the following relationships:

- The spring constant \( k \) affects how much deformation \( x \) occurs for a given weight \( F \).
- The weight \( F \) (force) directly affects the deformation \( x \) of the spring.
  
The causal relationships are:

- **Spring constant (k) → Deformation (x):** 1
- **Weight (F) → Deformation (x):** 1
- There is no direct causal relationship from deformation back to spring constant or weight, or between weight and spring constant directly in this context.

Variables:
1. **Spring Constant (k)**
2. **Weight (F)** (force exerted by the weight, equivalent to mg where m is mass and g is gravity)
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**

Causal Relationships:
- The **weight** applied to the spring directly causes the **deformation** of the spring. This is because the force exerted by the weight stretches (or compresses) the spring.
- The **spring constant** influences how much deformation results from the weight applied (a higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight).

Now, let's fill in the matrix:
```
[[0, 0, 1],  # Spring constant affects deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # Weight affects deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # Deformation does not cause change in spring constant or weight
```

Explanation:
- The spring constant does not directly cause a change in weight, but it does determine the deformation, given a certain weight.
- The weight directly causes deformation in the spring, depending on the spring constant.

2. **Weight**: The force applied to the spring.

The relationships are:

- The **weight** causes deformation: An increase in weight leads to more deformation.
- The **spring constant** affects deformation: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same weight.
- The deformation is mainly a result of the weight and spring constant, but doesn’t directly cause changes in these variables.
