- \( F \) is the force applied (related to the weight in this context)
- \( k \) is the spring constant
- \( x \) is the deformation (or displacement) of the spring

From this, we can infer the following causal relationships:
- The spring constant (\( k \)) affects the deformation (\( x \)) of the spring when a weight is applied. A stiffer spring (higher \( k \)) will deform less under the same weight.
- The weight (\( F \)) directly affects the deformation (\( x \)) of the spring. More weight leads to more deformation.
- The spring constant (\( k \)) does not cause changes in the weight.
- The weight does not cause changes in the spring constant.

1. **Spring Constant**: Affects how much a spring will stretch or compress under a given force.
2. **Weight**: The force applied to the spring.
3. **Deformation of Spring**: The amount the spring stretches or compresses in response to the weight.

Given Hooke's Law: \( F = k \cdot x \)

Where \( F \) is the force applied (weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation. We can derive the following causal relationships:

- **Weight causes Deformation of Spring**: More weight results in more deformation (proportional as per Hooke's Law).
- **Spring Constant causes Deformation of Spring**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same amount of weight.

There are no direct causal relationships where deformation or spring constant directly affects the weight or vice versa in this context beyond these.

2. **Weight (w)**: The force exerted on the spring, typically due to gravity on a mass.
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**: The change in length of the spring, often displacement.

Hooke's Law states \( F = kx \), where \( F \) is the force (weight) applied, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation.

### Causality Relationships:

- **Weight (w) causes Deformation (x)**: According to the formula, the weight applied to the spring directly causes deformation. 
- **Spring Constant (k) affects Deformation (x)**: A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight, but it doesn't ""cause"" deformation; it modulates how much deformation occurs due to the weight.

Explanation:

- There is no direct causation of `spring_constant` or `deformation` on `weight` directly; hence, those are zeros.
- There is no direct causation of `spring_constant` on `weight`.
- `Weight` directly causes `deformation of spring`.

1. **Hooke's Law** states that the deformation of a spring (extension or compression) is directly proportional to the force applied (weight) and inversely proportional to the spring constant. 
   
   \[ F = k \times x \]

   - Where \( F \) is the force applied by the weight,
   - \( k \) is the spring constant, and
   - \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

2. From Hooke's Law, the deformation of the spring is affected by both the spring constant and the weight.

Considering these principles, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant affects deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight affects deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation does not cause spring_constant or weight

The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ F = k \times x \]

where \( F \) is the force (weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

1. **Weight causes deformation of the spring**: Increasing the weight increases the force on the spring, leading to more deformation. Thus, the weight affects the deformation directly.

2. **Spring constant influences deformation of the spring**: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less under the same weight. Thus, the spring constant affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight.

3. **Weight does not directly affect the spring constant, and vice versa**: The spring constant is a property of the spring itself and does not change with different weights. Similarly, the weight does not inherently affect the property of the spring.

1. **Spring Constant (k)**: This is a measure of the stiffness of the spring.
2. **Weight (w)**: The force applied due to an object placed on the spring.
3. **Deformation of Spring (\( x \))**: The amount the spring stretches or compresses when a weight is applied.

According to Hookeâ€™s Law (\( F = kx \)), the deformation of the spring (x) is a result of the applied force (weight) and the spring constant. The relationships can be defined as:

- A change in the **weight** directly causes a change in the **deformation of the spring**.
- A change in the **spring constant** directly affects the **deformation of the spring**.

- \( F \) is the force applied to the spring (related to weight).
- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Here's how the relationships work:

1. **Weight affects deformation of spring**: More weight (force) results in greater deformation.
2. **Spring constant affects deformation of spring**: A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer and deforms less under the same force.

Now, filling the matrix based on these relationships:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant affects deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight affects deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause the other variables
```

Explanation:
- The spring constant and weight both cause the deformation of the spring.
- Deformation does not directly affect the spring constant or weight.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"
