1. **Spring Constant (k):** Determines the stiffness of the spring.
2. **Weight (F):** Acts as the force applied to the spring.
3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** The change in length of the spring.

According to Hooke's Law: \( F = k \times x \)

From this, we can deduce:

- The **weight** (force) affects the **deformation** of the spring: Changing the weight will change the deformation.
- The **spring constant** affects the **deformation**: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) resists deformation more.

Filling the matrix based on these relationships:

- **Weight** causes **Deformation**: 1
- **Spring Constant** causes **Deformation**: 1

2. **Weight (`w`)**: The force applied to the spring, which causes deformation.

3. **Deformation of Spring (`x`)**: The displacement or elongation of the spring when force is applied.

The relationship among them is described by Hooke’s Law:
\[ F = k \cdot x \]
Here, \( F \) is the force exerted by the weight. So, we consider force proportional to weight.

- The spring constant (`k`) affects how much deformation (`x`) occurs for a given weight.
- The weight (`w`) directly affects the deformation (`x`) of the spring.

- `spring_constant` causes `deformation of spring` because it determines how much deformation occurs for a given weight.

- **Weight causes Deformation of Spring**: Yes, more weight increases deformation.
- **Spring Constant causes Weight**: No, these are independent.
- **Weight causes Spring Constant**: No, these are independent.
- **Deformation of Spring causes Spring Constant or Weight**: No, the deformation is the effect, not a cause.

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force applied to the spring (related to the weight in this context),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

2. **Spring constant affects deformation of the spring:** The spring constant \( k \) affects how much deformation \( x \) occurs for a given weight \( F \).

\[ F = k \times x \]

- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Given these variables:

1. **Spring Constant (\( k \))**: This affects how much deformation a spring undergoes for a given weight.
2. **Weight (\( F \))**: This determines the force applied to the spring causing deformation.
3. **Deformation of Spring (\( x \))**: This is the result of applying a weight to the spring with a certain spring constant.

The causality matrix describing the relationships is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

### Explanation:

- **Spring Constant to Deformation**: The spring constant affects deformation (1 in \([0][2]\)).
- **Weight to Deformation**: The weight causes deformation (1 in \([1][2]\)).
