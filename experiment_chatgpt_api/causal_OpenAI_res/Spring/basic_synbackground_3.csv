**Variables:**

1. **Spring Constant (k)**
2. **Weight (w)**
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**

**Explanation of Relationships:**

- **Weight (w) causes Deformation (x):** According to Hooke's Law, the deformation (x) of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied (weight, w). So, the weight causes deformation.

- **Spring Constant (k) does not cause Deformation (x):** The spring constant itself doesn't cause deformation; it relates to how much a spring will deform under a given force. If weight is applied, it will determine the amount of deformation, but it is not a causal factor.

- **Spring Constant (k) affects the relationship between Weight (w) and Deformation (x):** It's part of the equation \( F = kx \), but in terms of direct cause, k is not causing deformation or weight.

Based on the above understanding, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Conclusion:**

- The matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that the weight (i = 1) causes the deformation (j = 2). 
- There are no other direct causal relationships among the spring constant, weight, or deformation in this context.","[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

where:
- \( F \) is the force (related to weight)
- \( k \) is the spring constant
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring

From this understanding, we determine:

1. **Spring Constant and Deformation:**
   - The spring constant does not directly cause deformation. Deformation is a result of the weight applied, given the spring constant.

2. **Weight and Deformation:**
   - The weight directly causes deformation. Greater weight leads to more deformation.

3. **Spring Constant and Weight:**
   - The spring constant does not directly affect the weight. These are independent variables in this context.

Using this understanding, the causality adjacency matrix can be filled as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

- `matrix[1][2] = 1`: Weight causes deformation.

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To fill the causality adjacency matrix, we need to understand the relationships between the variables based on the principles of physics, particularly Hooke's law, which relates the force exerted on a spring, the spring constant, and the deformation of the spring.

**Variables:**
1. **Spring constant** (\(k\))
2. **Weight** (\(F\)) - which causes a force on the spring and depends on the object's mass
3. **Deformation of spring** (\(x\))

**Hooke's Law:** 
\[ F = k \cdot x \]
where \(F\) is the force (related to weight), \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(x\) is the deformation.

### Causal Relationships

1. **Weight \(F\) (causes) Deformation \(x\)**:
   - The weight determines the force applied to the spring, which causes deformation. Thus, there is a direct causal relationship.
  
2. **Spring Constant \(k\) (causes) Deformation \(x\)**:
   - The spring constant determines how much the spring deforms for a given force. A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight. Thus, there is a direct causal relationship.
  
3. **Weight \(F\) and Spring Constant \(k\)**:
   - No direct causal relationship. The spring constant is a property of the spring, not affected by the weight.

Using these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix should be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

1. **Weight** causes **Deformation of Spring**: An increase in weight leads to more deformation.
2. **Spring Constant** affects the **Deformation of Spring**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight.
