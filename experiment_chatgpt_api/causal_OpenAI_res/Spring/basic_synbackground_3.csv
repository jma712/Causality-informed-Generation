**Variables:**

1. **Spring Constant (k)**
2. **Weight (w)**
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**

**Explanation of Relationships:**

- **Weight (w) causes Deformation (x):** According to Hooke's Law, the deformation (x) of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied (weight, w). So, the weight causes deformation.

- **Spring Constant (k) does not cause Deformation (x):** The spring constant itself doesn't cause deformation; it relates to how much a spring will deform under a given force. If weight is applied, it will determine the amount of deformation, but it is not a causal factor.

- **Spring Constant (k) affects the relationship between Weight (w) and Deformation (x):** It's part of the equation \( F = kx \), but in terms of direct cause, k is not causing deformation or weight.

Based on the above understanding, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

**Conclusion:**

- The matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that the weight (i = 1) causes the deformation (j = 2). 
- There are no other direct causal relationships among the spring constant, weight, or deformation in this context.","[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

\[ F = k \times x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force (related to weight)
- \( k \) is the spring constant
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring

From this understanding, we determine:

1. **Spring Constant and Deformation:**
   - The spring constant does not directly cause deformation. Deformation is a result of the weight applied, given the spring constant.

2. **Weight and Deformation:**
   - The weight directly causes deformation. Greater weight leads to more deformation.

3. **Spring Constant and Weight:**
   - The spring constant does not directly affect the weight. These are independent variables in this context.

Using this understanding, the causality adjacency matrix can be filled as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

- `matrix[1][2] = 1`: Weight causes deformation.

**Variables:**
1. **Spring constant** (\(k\))
2. **Weight** (\(F\)) - which causes a force on the spring and depends on the object's mass
3. **Deformation of spring** (\(x\))

**Hooke's Law:** 
\[ F = k \cdot x \]
where \(F\) is the force (related to weight), \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(x\) is the deformation.

### Causal Relationships

1. **Weight \(F\) (causes) Deformation \(x\)**:
   - The weight determines the force applied to the spring, which causes deformation. Thus, there is a direct causal relationship.
  
2. **Spring Constant \(k\) (causes) Deformation \(x\)**:
   - The spring constant determines how much the spring deforms for a given force. A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight. Thus, there is a direct causal relationship.
  
3. **Weight \(F\) and Spring Constant \(k\)**:
   - No direct causal relationship. The spring constant is a property of the spring, not affected by the weight.

Using these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix should be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

1. **Weight** causes **Deformation of Spring**: An increase in weight leads to more deformation.
2. **Spring Constant** affects the **Deformation of Spring**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for a given weight.
