   - \( k \) is the spring constant.

2. **Weight (`F`)**: Directly causes deformation of the spring.

- The **weight** causes the deformation, given a constant spring constant.

1. **Weight causes deformation of spring**: The weight (force due to gravity) on the spring causes it to deform. Hence, there is a direct causal relationship here.

Based on this, the causal relationships are:

- The weight causes the deformation of the spring (more weight leads to more deformation).
- The spring constant affects the deformation (a stiffer spring, i.e., a higher spring constant, results in less deformation for the same weight).

 [0, 0, 1],  # weight affects deformation

Explanation:

- `spring_constant` causes `deformation of spring` because a change in the spring constant affects how much the spring will deform under a given weight.
- `weight` causes `deformation of spring` because adding more weight increases the force applied, thereby increasing deformation.

2. **Weight**: The weight applies a force due to gravity.
3. **Deformation of Spring**: This is caused by the weight and affected by the spring constant.

1. **Spring Constant and Deformation:** The spring constant (k) is a factor that influences the deformation (x) of the spring. According to Hooke's Law, \( F = kx \), where F is the force applied (related to weight here). A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) results in less deformation for the same weight.

2. **Weight and Deformation:** The weight directly causes deformation. The force of the weight stretches or compresses the spring, leading to deformation.

3. **Spring Constant and Weight:** There is no direct causal relationship between the spring constant and the weight itself in this context.

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation of spring

- **Weight**: The force exerted by an object due to gravity, causing the spring to deform.
- **Deformation of spring**: The change in length of the spring due to the applied weight.
