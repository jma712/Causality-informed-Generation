- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this, we can infer the causal relationships:

1. **Weight affects deformation**: Increasing the weight increases the deformation of the spring (direct causal relationship).
2. **Spring constant affects deformation**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same weight (direct causal relationship).
3. **Weight does not affect spring constant**: The spring constant is an inherent property of the spring and is not affected by the weight.
4. **Spring constant does not affect weight**: The weight applied is independent of the spring’s properties.
