From Hooke's Law, the force (or weight, in this context) on a spring is proportional to the deformation (or deflection) of the spring according to the spring constant. Mathematically, \( F = k \cdot x \), where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Based on this:

1. **Weight causes deformation**: The weight applied to the spring directly causes its deformation.
2. **Spring constant affects deformation**: The spring constant determines how much deformation occurs for a given weight.
3. **No direct cause from deformation to weight or spring constant**: The deformation doesn't cause changes in the weight or the spring constant within this simple model.

Causality adjacency matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant affects deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause weight or spring constant
```

Explanation:
- `spring_constant` and `weight` both affect `deformation of spring`.
- There's no reverse causality affecting `spring_constant` or `weight` directly from `deformation`.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

Based on this:

1. The spring constant (\( k \)) affects the deformation of the spring. A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer, resulting in less deformation for the same applied force.
2. The weight (\( F \)) directly causes deformation of the spring. More weight results in more force, leading to more deformation if the spring constant is fixed.

1. **Spring Constant (k):** This is a property of the spring itself and affects how much it deforms under a given weight.
2. **Weight (F):** This is the force applied to the spring, affecting its deformation.
3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** This is how much the spring stretches or compresses in response to the applied weight. According to Hooke's Law, \( F = k \times x \).

Using this relationship:
- Spring constant **causes** deformation, as it determines how much force results in what deformation.
- Weight **causes** deformation directly, as more weight increases deformation.
