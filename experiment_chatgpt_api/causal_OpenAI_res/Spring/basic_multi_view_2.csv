\[ F = k \times x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight in this context).
- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

The relationships are as follows:
1. The spring constant (\( k \)) affects how much the spring deforms (\( x \)) for a given weight.
2. The weight (\( F \)) affects the deformation (\( x \)) of the spring because the weight is the force acting on the spring.

Based on this:

- The spring constant does not directly cause a change in weight.
- The weight does not cause a change in the spring constant.
- The deformation is caused by both the spring constant and the weight.

Using this, you can determine the causal relationships:

1. **Spring Constant (k)**: Affects the amount of deformation (x) for a given weight (F). A larger spring constant means less deformation for the same weight.

2. **Weight (F)**: Directly causes deformation (x). Increased weight increases deformation assuming constant spring constant.

According to Hooke's Law, the relationship between these variables can be described using the equation \( F = k \cdot x \), where \( F \) (force) is related to the weight. Therefore, we have these causal relationships:

- **Weight (w) causes Deformation (x):** The weight affects how much the spring stretches or compresses.
- **Spring Constant (k) causes Deformation (x):** The spring constant determines how resistant the spring is to deformation under a given weight.

The matrix will look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant causes deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight causes deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation has no causal effect on spring_constant or weight
```

Explanation of the matrix:

- `spring_constant → deformation` because the spring constant affects how much a spring will deform.
- `weight → deformation` because the weight placed on the spring causes it to deform.
- No direct causal relationship from deformation to spring constant or weight, as deformation is an effect, not a cause in this context.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"
