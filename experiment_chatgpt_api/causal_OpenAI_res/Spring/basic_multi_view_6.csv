1. **Spring Constant (k):** This is a property of the spring itself. It affects how much the spring can be deformed by a given weight.

### Variables:
1. **Spring Constant:** Characteristic of the spring determining its stiffness.
2. **Weight:** Force applied to the spring causing deformation.
3. **Deformation of Spring:** Result of applying weight to the spring.

### Causal Relationships:
- **Weight causes Deformation of Spring:** When a weight is placed on a spring, it causes the spring to deform (either compress or extend).
- **Spring Constant affects the relationship between Weight and Deformation:** A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will result in less deformation for the same weight compared to a softer spring (lower spring constant).

```
[[0, 0, 0],

- Weight causes deformation directly.

   - The weight acts as a force on the spring, causing it to deform.

2. **Spring Constant influences Deformation:**
   - The spring constant determines how much force is needed for a certain amount of deformation.  

3. **Spring Constant and Weight have no direct causal relationship:**
   - The weight doesn't influence the spring constant and vice versa; they affect the deformation independently.

 [0, 0, 1],  # weight does not affect spring_constant or weight, does affect defomation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # defomation does not directly affect spring_constant, weight, or defomation

Explanation:
- **Spring constant** causes **deformation**:  The spring's resistance to deformation is directly related to the spring constant (thus a causal link to deformation).
