2. **Weight (W)**: The force acting on the spring due to gravity on the mass.
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**: The amount the spring stretches or compresses.

This law is often expressed as \( F = k \cdot x \), where \( F \) is the force applied (weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Here's how we can fill the causality adjacency matrix:

- **Weight causes deformation of spring**: Increasing the weight will increase the deformation if the spring constant remains the same.
- **Spring constant causes deformation of spring**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same weight.

The matrix would look like this:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:

- The first row indicates that the spring constant affects the deformation of the spring.
- The second row indicates that the weight affects the deformation of the spring.
- The third row indicates that neither spring constant nor weight causes another variable (since we aren’t considering feedback).

1. **Spring Constant**: The spring constant (\(k\)) is a property of the spring and influences how much a spring deforms under a given weight. It does not get affected directly by weight or deformation.

2. **Weight**: The weight causes the deformation of the spring, as per the formula \(F = kx\) where \(F\) is the force or weight applied, \(k\) is the spring constant, and \(x\) is the deformation.

3. **Deformation of Spring**: The deformation is the result of the weight acting on the spring and is influenced by the spring constant.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix can be filled out as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # Spring Constant influences Deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # Weight influences Deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # Deformation does not influence Spring Constant or Weight
```

Explanation:

- The spring constant directly affects how much the spring deforms when a weight is applied.
- The weight causes the deformation of the spring.
- Deformation itself does not affect the spring constant or the weight.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Spring Constant (`spring_constant`)**: This is a property of the spring itself and does not change due to external factors like weight or deformation but affects how much the spring deforms under a given weight.

2. **Weight (`weight`)**: The weight placed on the spring causes the deformation. More weight generally leads to more deformation, assuming the spring constant is unchanged.

3. **Deformation of Spring (`deformation`)**: This is the result of the interplay between the weight and the spring constant.

Based on this logic, the causal relationships are:

- **Spring Constant to Deformation**: The spring constant affects the extent of deformation under a given weight.
- **Weight to Deformation**: The weight directly affects the deformation, given a constant spring constant.

Thus, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- `spring_constant` affects `deformation` but not the reverse.
- `weight` affects `deformation` but not the reverse.
- There are no direct causal effects from deformation back to either spring_constant or weight.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To fill the causality adjacency matrix, let's consider Hooke's Law, which relates these variables: deformation (\( x \)) in a spring is proportional to the force or weight (\( F \)) applied, and inversely proportional to the spring constant (\( k \)). Hooke's Law is expressed as:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Here's how the causation works:

1. The weight directly causes deformation. The heavier the weight, the more the spring deforms, assuming the spring constant remains the same.
2. The spring constant influences the deformation. A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) results in less deformation, given the same weight.
3. Weight and spring constant do not directly cause each other.

Based on this:

- Weight causes deformation (\( x \)).
- Spring constant affects deformation (\( x \)).
- There are no direct causal relationships between weight and spring constant.

The causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- Row 1 (spring_constant): Influences deformation.
- Row 2 (weight): Influences deformation.
- Row 3 (deformation of spring): No direct influence on the other variables.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To understand the causal relationships among the variables in the context of Hooke's Law, we consider:

1. **Spring Constant (\(k\))**: A property of the spring itself, indicating its stiffness.
2. **Weight (\(F\))**: The force applied to the spring, typically the weight of an object.
3. **Deformation of Spring (\(x\))**: The change in length of the spring, also called displacement.

According to Hooke's Law: 

\[ F = kx \]

This implies:
- The **weight** (force) causes the **deformation** (displacement). 
- The **spring constant** influences how much the spring deforms in response to a given **weight**.

Thus, the causal relationships can be described as follows:

- **Weight causes Deformation**: More weight results in more deformation.
- **Spring Constant affects Deformation**: A higher spring constant leads to less deformation for the same weight, but it doesn't cause deformation directly.

Hence, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- `matrix[0][2] = 1`: Spring constant affects deformation.
- `matrix[1][2] = 1`: Weight causes deformation.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"
