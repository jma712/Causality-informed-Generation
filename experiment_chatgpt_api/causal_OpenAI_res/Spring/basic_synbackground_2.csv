1. **Spring Constant (k) and Deformation (x):**
   - The spring constant \( k \) directly affects how much deformation or displacement \( x \) will occur for a given weight.
   - Therefore, spring constant causes deformation.

2. **Weight and Deformation (x):**
   - The weight causes deformation of the spring.

\[ F = k \times \Delta x \]

- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight)
- \( k \) is the spring constant

From this, we can derive the following relationships:

1. **Weight (force) causes deformation**: The weight affects how much the spring deforms.

- **spring_constant → defomation of spring**: 1; the spring constant affects the deformation directly.
- **weight → defomation of spring**: 1; the weight causes deformation.
- All other relationships are zero; neither spring constant nor weight directly causes each other. The deformation is a result of these two factors interacting.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Spring constant** (`k`) affects the deformation of the spring (`x`) according to Hooke's law: `F = k * x`.
2. **Weight** (`F`), which includes force due to gravity, also affects the deformation of the spring.
3. Deformation does not directly affect the spring constant or weight.

**Explanation:**
- **spring_constant (k) → deformation of spring (x):** The spring constant affects deformation. A higher spring constant makes the spring stiffer, resulting in less deformation for the same weight.
- **weight (F) → deformation of spring (x):** The weight causes the spring to deform. More weight generally results in more deformation.

The relationship is given by:

\[ F = k \times x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to weight in this context)
- \( k \) is the spring constant
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring

From this, we can derive the causal relationships among the variables:

1. The **weight** (force) causes **deformation**.
2. The **spring constant** affects the distribution of force, thus causing variation in **deformation**.

Based on these relationships, the causality adjacency matrix can be filled out as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0],]

Explanation:
- There is no direct causal relationship from the spring constant or weight to each other, so those entries are 0.
- The spring constant and weight each cause changes in the deformation of the spring, hence the 1s in the matrix for those relationships.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"
