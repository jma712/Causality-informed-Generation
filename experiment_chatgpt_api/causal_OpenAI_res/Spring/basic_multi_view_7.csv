- `spring_constant` affects `deformation of spring` because the stiffness of the spring impacts how much it will deform under a given force.
- `weight` affects `deformation of spring` because the actual force applied on the spring determines how much it will deform.
- There is no direct causal relationship from `spring_constant` to `weight` or vice versa; similarly, `deformation of spring` does not directly cause changes in `spring_constant` or `weight`.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

1. **Hooke's Law** states that the deformation (or displacement) of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied to it, often the weight in this context. The spring constant determines the stiffness of the spring. The relationship can be represented as:
   \[
   F = k \cdot x
