1. **Spring Constant (k)**: Determines how stiff the spring is. A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same amount of force (weight).

2. **Weight (W)**: The force applied to the spring. More weight will cause more deformation, depending on the spring constant.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**: The result of the force applied by the weight, dependent on the spring constant. It is given by \( F = k \times x \).

- \( k \) is the spring constant.

Here's the causality reasoning:

1. **Spring Constant (k):** This variable affects how much the spring deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant means less deformation.

2. **Weight (W):** This directly causes the deformation of the spring. Greater weight results in greater deformation.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x):** This is the result of the weight applied on the spring and the properties (spring constant) of the spring.

The matrix representing these causal relationships is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # Spring constant (k) affects deformation (x)
 [0, 0, 1],  # Weight (W) affects deformation (x)
 [0, 0, 0]]  # Deformation doesn't cause changes in k or W
```

Explanation:
- Spring constant (k) affects deformation but not weight.
- Weight (W) affects deformation but not the spring constant directly.
- Deformation is an outcome of the other two variables and does not affect them directly.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force applied to the spring (related to weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant, and
- \( x \) is the deformation (displacement) of the spring.

From this equation, we can infer the following causal relationships:
1. The weight (force) causes deformation of the spring.
2. The spring constant affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight (force).

Now let's fill the causality adjacency matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],   # spring_constant affects deformation
 [0, 0, 1],   # weight affects deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]   # deformation does not cause anything else directly

1. **Spring Constant (k)**: This is a property of the spring itself and determines how much force is necessary to deform it. It affects the deformation directly when weight is applied.

2. **Weight (W)**: The weight applied to the spring will cause it to deform according to the spring constant.

3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**: This is the result of weight applied to the spring and is determined by both the weight and the spring constant according to Hookeâ€™s Law, \( F = kx \), where \( F \) is the force (weight).

Causal relationships based on Hooke's Law:

- Spring constant affects deformation.
- Weight affects deformation.

\[ F = k \times x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force applied (related to the weight in this context),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation (displacement) of the spring.

Based on this relationship:
1. **Weight causes deformation of spring**: The weight applies a force that causes the spring to deform based on the spring constant.
2. **Spring constant influences deformation of spring**: A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight, and vice versa.

The matrix is then structured as follows:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant -> deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight -> deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation of spring does not cause the other variables
```

Explanation:
- There is no direct causation from ""spring constant"" or ""weight"" to each other, only to ""deformation of spring.""
- ""Deformation of spring"" is an effect and, therefore, does not cause the other variables.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"
