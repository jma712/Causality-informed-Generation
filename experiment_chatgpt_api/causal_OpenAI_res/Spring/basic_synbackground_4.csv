- \( x \) is the deformation (compression/extension) of the spring.

- \( k \) is the spring constant.

1. **Hooke's Law**: The deformation of a spring (compression or extension) is directly proportional to the force (weight) applied to it, and inversely proportional to the spring constant.

Given this, we can establish the causal relationships as follows:

- **Weight** causes **Deformation of Spring**: The more weight applied, the more deformation.
- **Spring Constant** affects **Deformation of Spring**: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less under the same weight.
  
Now, let's construct the matrix based on these relationships:

1. **Deformation of Spring** is caused by:
   - Weight (directly proportional, i.e., 1)
   - Spring constant (inversely proportional, i.e., 1)

2. **Weight** and **Spring Constant** do not directly cause each other in the context given.

\[ F = k \times x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force applied by the weight.
- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Considering this, the relationships are:

1. **Weight causes Deformation**: The weight applies a force on the spring, causing it to deform.
2. **Spring Constant affects Deformation**: The stiffness of the spring (spring constant) affects how much the spring deforms under a given weight.

Therefore, the causality adjacency matrix is:
