1. **Weight affects deformation of the spring**: 
   - The weight (force due to gravity) causes the spring to deform, so the relationship is weight → deformation.

2. **Spring constant affects deformation of the spring**: 
   - The spring constant determines how much the spring deforms for a given weight, so there is a relationship spring constant → deformation.

3. **Weight and spring constant don't directly affect each other**:
   - The weight does not affect the spring constant directly, and the spring constant does not affect the weight.

\[ F = k \times x \]

Where:
- \( F \) is the force (related to the weight in this context).
- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this relationship, we can deduce the following causality:

1. The weight (force applied) causes the deformation of the spring.
2. The spring constant affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight.

Thus, the causality adjacency matrix would be:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```

Explanation:
- `spring_constant` does not directly cause `weight`, but it affects `defomation of spring` (third column).
- `weight` causes `defomation of spring`.
- There is no direct causal link from `defomation of spring` to either `spring_constant` or `weight`.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

In the matrix, matrix[i][j] = 1 means variable i causes variable j, matrix[i][j] = 0 means there is not direct causal relationship.","To determine the causal relationships among the variables spring_constant, weight, and deformation of spring, we can apply Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the displacement (deformation) of the spring:

\[ F = k \cdot x \]

Where \( F \) is the force (related to weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Based on this relationship:

1. **Weight causes deformation of spring:** More weight increases the force applied on the spring, leading to greater deformation. Thus, weight has a direct causal effect on the deformation of the spring.

2. **Spring constant affects deformation of spring:** A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer, leading to less deformation for the same weight. Hence, the spring constant affects deformation.

3. **No direct causation from spring constant to weight or from weight to spring constant:** These are independent properties.

With these considerations, the causality adjacency matrix is:

```
[[0, 0, 1],

1. The **weight** (force) applied to a spring causes its **deformation** (compression or extension) according to Hooke's law, which states that deformation is directly proportional to the force applied.

2. The **spring constant** affects how much the spring deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant means the spring is stiffer and deforms less for the same weight.

Explanation:

- `spring_constant` (1st element in each row) does not directly cause `weight` or `deformation`. It interacts with them via Hooke's law (relatedness, not causality).
- `weight` (2nd element in each row) causes `deformation` (3rd element in each row).
- `deformation` is the result of `spring_constant` and `weight`, so it doesn't cause either.","[[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0]]"

- \( k \) is the spring constant.
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

1. The weight causes the deformation of the spring. The force applied due to the weight leads to the spring deforming.
