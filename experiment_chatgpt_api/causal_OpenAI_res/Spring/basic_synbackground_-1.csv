\[ F = k \cdot x \]

where \( F \) is the force applied to the spring, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring. The force \( F \) is generally due to the weight applied (assuming the weight is the only factor causing the deformation).

### Relationships:

1. **Spring Constant (\( k \)) and Deformation (\( x \))**:
   - The spring constant \( k \) affects how much a spring deforms under a given weight. A higher spring constant means less deformation for the same weight.

2. **Weight (\( F \)) and Deformation (\( x \))**:
   - Increasing the weight increases the deformation of the spring proportionally.

Based on these relationships, we complete the matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],   # spring_constant affects deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 1],   # weight affects deformation of spring
 [0, 0, 0],   # deformation of spring does not cause changes in spring_constant or weight
]
```

### Explanation
- **spring_constant -> deformation**: A higher spring constant results in less deformation.
- **weight -> deformation**: More weight results in more deformation.

From this relationship, we can deduce:

1. The **weight** (force) directly causes **deformation**.
2. The **spring constant** affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight, so it also directly causes **deformation**.

1. **Spring Constant to Deformation**: The spring constant does not cause a change in deformation directly. However, it affects how much deformation occurs for a given weight. It moderates the effect but does not cause it directly. So, we will put 0.

2. **Weight to Deformation**: The weight causes deformation directly, as seen in Hooke's Law (F = kx). So, we will put 1.

3. **Spring Constant to Weight**: There is no causal relationship here. The spring constant does not affect the weight. So, we will put 0.

4. **Weight to Spring Constant**: The weight does not affect the spring constant. So, we will put 0.

5. **Deformation to Spring Constant**: The deformation does not cause a change in the spring constant. So, we will put 0.

1. **Spring Constant (k):**
   - The spring constant determines how much force is needed to deform the spring by a certain amount. Hence, it affects the deformation of the spring.

1. **Spring Constant (k)**: Affects how much a spring deforms when a weight is applied.
2. **Weight (W)**: Determines the force applied to the spring, affecting its deformation.
3. **Deformation of Spring (x)**: This is the result of the other two variables acting together.

### Causal Relationships:

- The **weight** causes **deformation**: The force (due to the weight) applied to the spring directly affects how much it deforms.
- The **spring constant** causes **deformation**: A stiffer spring (higher spring constant) will deform less under the same weight.

### Matrix:

Based on the above reasoning, the causality adjacency matrix can be represented as:

```
[[0, 0, 1],  # spring_constant -> deformation
 [0, 0, 1],  # weight -> deformation
 [0, 0, 0]]  # deformation doesn't cause the others

- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

From this relationship:
1. The deformation of the spring (\( x \)) is directly affected by both the spring constant (\( k \)) and the weight (\( F \)).

Thus the causality adjacency matrix can be structured as follows:

 [0, 0, 1],  # weight -> defomation of spring
 [0, 0, 0]]  # defomation of spring does not directly cause spring_constant or weight

Where \( F \) is the force (weight), \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

### Explanation:

1. **spring_constant → deformation of spring**: The deformation of the spring is affected by the spring constant, hence a causal relationship exists.

2. **weight → deformation of spring**: The weight (force) directly influences how much the spring deforms.
