\[ F = k \times x \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force applied on the spring (related to the weight),
- \( k \) is the spring constant,
- \( x \) is the deformation of the spring.

Using this relationship:

1. **Weight (as force) affects deformation of spring (\( F = k \times x \)):**
   - Increasing weight leads to increased deformation.
   
2. **Spring constant affects deformation of a spring (\( F = k \times x \)):**
   - A higher spring constant results in less deformation for the same weight.

3. **Deformation of spring does not directly affect weight or spring constant** (it's a result, not a cause).
