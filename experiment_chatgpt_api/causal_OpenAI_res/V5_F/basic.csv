1. **Ball's Volume:**
   - The volume of a ball (sphere) depends on its radius. No other given variables directly influence it.

2. **Cuboid's Height & Base Area:**
   - The volume of a cuboid is calculated as height Ã— base area. Thus, the base area of the cuboid and cuboid's height determines the volume (not given) rather than affecting each other directly.

3. **Cone's Height & Base Area:**
   - Similar to the cuboid, the volume of a cone depends on its height and base area (not directly related to each other).

2. **Cuboid's Height**: This does not directly cause or affect other variables regarding shape or dimension in the current context.

3. **Cone's Height and Base Area of Cone**: The volume of the cone is determined by its base area and height. These two variables are mutually independent in terms of causal effect between themselves in the absence of considering volume as a factor.

1. Ball's volume \( V_b \)
2. Cuboid's height \( H_c \)
3. Base area of cuboid \( A_{bc} \)
4. Base area of cone \( A_{bc} \)
5. Cone's height \( H_{\text{cone}} \)

We'll consider direct causal relationships:

### Causal Relationships:
- **Ball's volume** is independent of the other variables.
- **Cuboid's volume** depends on its height and base area (\( V_{\text{cuboid}} = A_{bc} \times H_c \)). However, this is about base area, not volume.
- **Cone's volume** also depends on its base area and height (\( V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} A_{bc} \times H_{\text{cone}} \)). Again, looking at base area alone.

### Building the Matrix:
- Direct dependencies (cause and effect) among base area and height for both cuboid and cone are noted, affecting volume indirectly here.
- No direct inter-object dependency observed for other shapes.

Therefore, no dependencies are present among these specific properties, barring complex volumetric formulas not needing detailing here as per the base area request:

2. **Cuboid's Height**: Affects the volume of the cuboid when combined with its base area.
3. **Base Area of Cuboid**: Affects the volume of the cuboid when combined with its height.

- The **cuboid's height** and **base area** directly affect each other regarding volume calculations, but neither one affects the ball or cone.
- The **cone's base area** and **height** directly affect each other regarding volume calculations, but neither one affects the ball or cuboid.
