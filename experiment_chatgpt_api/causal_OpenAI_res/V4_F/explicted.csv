- The volume of a sphere (ball) is dependent on its radius, and not directly on the properties of a cuboid or a cone.

- The height of a cuboid does not directly affect the base area of the cuboid. However, for a fixed volume, changes in height might necessitate changes in base area, which could imply a dependent relationship if volume is constant.

- The base area of a cuboid and the base area of a cone might not have a direct causal relationship unless specified by some geometric constraints within a specific context.
