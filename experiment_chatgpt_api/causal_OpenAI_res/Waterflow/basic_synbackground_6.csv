1. **Ball Volume (1)**: The ball's volume doesn't directly affect other variables, but it may indirectly affect water height by displacing water. However, it doesnâ€™t directly influence the diameter of the cup, hole height, or length of water flow.

2. **Diameter of the Bottom of Cup (2)**: This affects the water height in the cup (more volume for the same amount of water results in lower water height) but doesn't directly affect the hole height or the length of the water flow.

3. **Water Height in the Cup (3)**: This affects the length of water flow from the cup due to the relationship between water pressure and flow distance, and also indirectly affects if there's any overflow, but it can be a consequence rather than a cause for hole height. It may also be indirectly influenced by the ball volume due to displacement.

4. **Hole Height on the Cup (4)**: The hole's height affects the water height after some time (water will drain only to the height of the hole) and the length of the water flow, but doesn't influence ball volume or the cup diameter.

5. **Length of Water Flow Away from the Cup (5)**: This is directly affected by water height in the cup and the hole height, as they influence the pressure and potential flow speed.

2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** might affect the water height (displacement and volume distribution) and indirectly influence water flow, but usually, it doesn't directly cause changes in other variables.

3. **Water height in the cup** affects the pressure at the hole and hence the length of water flow away from the cup through the hole.

   - Affects whether or not the water can reach the hole depending on the height of the water relative to the hole height.

4. **Hole height on the cup**:
