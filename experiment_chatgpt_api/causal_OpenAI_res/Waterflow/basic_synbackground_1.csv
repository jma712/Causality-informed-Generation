1. **Ball volume**: Affects the water height in the cup due to displacement: more volume means higher water level.
   
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup**: Influences the water height for the same volume of water; a wider diameter means lower water height for the same amount of water.

3. **Water height in the cup**: Directly affects the pressure at the hole level, which impacts the water flow length. More height means more pressure and a longer flow. 

4. **Hole height on the cup**: Affects the water flow length; a higher hole means less pressure and shorter flow (since the reference point for water pressure is lower).

5. **Length of water flow away from the cup**: Is influenced by both water height and hole height. Does not directly cause changes in other parameters in this setup.

- **Ball volume** affects **Water height in the cup**.
- **Diameter of the bottom of cup** affects **Water height in the cup**.

### Possible Causal Relationships:

1. **Ball Volume**: 
    - Does not directly affect water flow length but affects water height (displacement principle).

2. **Diameter of the Bottom of Cup**: 
    - Affects water height (larger diameter means lower water height for the same volume).

3. **Water Height in the Cup**: 
    - Directly affects the length of water flow (higher water height increases pressure, leading to longer flow).
    - Affects hole height indirectly, as raising water will overflow from lower holes first.

4. **Hole Height on the Cup**: 
    - Affects the water height at which the flow begins (higher hole means flow starts at higher water height).

5. **Length of Water Flow Away from the Cup**: 
    - Affected directly by water height and hole height (because of changes in water pressure).

### Explanation:

   - Influences the water height for a given volume of water.

### Explanation:

1. **Ball Volume → Water Height**: The volume of the ball displaces water, influencing the height of the water in the cup.
   
2. **Diameter of the Bottom of the Cup → Length of Water Flow**: A larger diameter may change the dynamics of water flow, although this is more inferred than directly seen in the images.

3. **Water Height → Hole Height**: The height of the water determines how much water can cover or pass through the hole.

   - Does not directly affect the diameter of the bottom of the cup, hole height, or the length of water flow.
  
2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup**:
   - Does not affect water height, hole height, or the water flow directly due to the nature of this system.
   - Larger diameter may influence the amount of water initially in the cup, but not substantially without more context.

3. **Water height in the cup**:
   - Directly affects the flow of water from the hole, influencing the length of the water flow due to gravity and pressure.
   - Is affected by the ball volume (displacement) and the cup’s diameter to some extent.
  
4. **Hole height on the cup**:
   - Directly affects the water flow length. Higher holes release water with more pressure initially.
   - Does not affect ball volume, cup diameter directly, or water height before flow begins.
  
5. **Length of water flow away from the cup**:
   - Is determined by the water height in the cup and the hole height.

2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup**:

3. **Water height in the cup**:
   - Higher water level increases pressure, affecting both the hole height influence and the length of water flow.

4. **Hole height on the cup**:
   - The location impacts how far the water flows out, as pressure is affected by height.

3. **Water Height in the Cup:**
   - Affects the length of water flow due to increased gravitational pressure.
   - Influences flow height by affecting water pressure through the hole.

4. **Hole Height on the Cup:**
   - Directly affects the length of the water flow by changing the potential energy and pressure at the point of exit.
