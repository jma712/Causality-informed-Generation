1. **Ball volume**: Affects the water height in the cup due to displacement but does not directly influence other variables. 

2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup**: Affects the water height due to volume capacity and indirectly affects the length of the water flow by influencing the water pressure but does not directly influence other variables.

3. **Water height in the cup**: Directly affects the length of water flow since the pressure at the hole depends on the water height. It could be influenced by ball volume and cup diameter.

4. **Hole height on the cup**: Directly affects the length of water flow since it determines the pressure exerted by the water at the hole. It is not influenced by any other listed variables directly.

5. **Length of water flow away from the cup**: Directly influenced by water height and hole height.

- Ball Volume → Water Height
- Diameter of Cup → Water Height
- Water Height → Length of Water Flow
- Hole Height → Length of Water Flow

1. **Ball volume**:
   - Directly affects the water height in the cup (displacement principle).
   - No direct effect on the other variables.

2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup**:
   - May affect the water height in the cup (for a given volume of water, a larger diameter results in a lower water height).
   - Could influence the length of water flowing away due to the width affecting how water flows out.

3. **Water height in the cup**:
   - Influences the length of water flow away from the cup (more water pressure due to height results in a longer flow).
   - Affected by the ball volume and diameter of the cup.

4. **Hole height on the cup**:
   - Directly affects the water height in the cup (if water leaks out from the hole).
   - Impacts the length of water flow away from the cup since the water's potential energy is determined by its height.

1. **Ball volume** affects **water height in the cup** because it displaces water when the ball is submerged.

2. **Diameter of the bottom of the cup** affects **water height in the cup** if the volume of water is constant since a smaller diameter would mean a higher water level.

3. **Water height in the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup** since the pressure at the hole (and thus flow speed and length) is related to the water height. It may also affect **hole height on the cup** in terms of overflow, but not directly as given.

4. **Hole height on the cup** affects **length of water flow away from the cup** because it determines the pressure from which the water exits, affecting the speed and thus the distance.

Let's encode these into a causality adjacency matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Ball volume affects water height
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # Diameter affects water height
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Water height affects flow length
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],  # Hole height affects flow length
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]  # Flow length is not causing any other factors directly
```

### Explanation:

- Ball volume affects water height (displacement).
- Diameter affects water height (inversely, if water volume is constant).
- Water height affects flow length (pressure-driven flow).
- Hole height affects flow length (higher hole, shorter flow distance due to reduced pressure head).
